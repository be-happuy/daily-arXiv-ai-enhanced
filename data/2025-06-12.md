### [1] [ReStNet: A Reusable & Stitchable Network for Dynamic Adaptation on IoT Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09066)
*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Jiaqi Nie,Zeyu Wang,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet提出了一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接预训练模型来适应不同设备的资源限制，实现灵活的效率-精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在异构IoT设备上部署的挑战，传统压缩方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过CKA计算层间相似度选择拼接点，拼接大模型的前层和小模型的后层，仅微调拼接层。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现灵活的效率-精度权衡，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet为异构设备部署提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

### [2] [Enhancing the Safety of Medical Vision-Language Models by Synthetic Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09067)
*Zhiyu Xue,Reza Abbasi-Asl,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的推理时防御策略，用于增强生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）的安全性，同时避免过度防御导致的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成复杂医学文本时存在安全漏洞，需要拒绝有害查询，但现有方法可能导致过度防御，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出基于合成临床演示的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性。

Result: 防御策略显著提升了模型安全性，且未显著影响性能；增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 混合演示策略在少样本预算下平衡了安全性和性能，为Med-VLMs的安全应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

### [4] [Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF):An automatic segmentation model for building facades, walls and windows based on multimodal semantics guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09071)
*Peilin Li,Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Ran Luo,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAAF模型通过多模态语义引导实现建筑立面墙窗自动分割，结合自然语言处理提升语义理解，端到端训练减少人工干预，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高建筑信息模型和计算机辅助设计的效率，解决墙窗自动分割的精度和泛化能力问题。

Method: 提出多模态语义协作特征提取机制，结合文本描述与图像特征，开发端到端训练框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上mIoU指标优于现有方法，保持高精度分割能力。

Conclusion: SAAF在墙窗分割任务中取得进展，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

*Xinlong Chen,Yuanxing Zhang,Yushuo Guan,Bohan Zeng,Yang Shi,Sihan Yang,Pengfei Wan,Qiang Liu,Liang Wang,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个新数据集DarkEventInfer和MixVidQA，用于提升视频理解和推理能力，并开发了VersaVid-R1模型，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频推理领域缺乏高质量数据和有效训练方法，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入两个新数据集，结合强化学习开发VersaVid-R1模型。

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: VersaVid-R1为视频理解和推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlagEvalMM是一个开源的多模态模型评估框架，支持多种视觉-语言任务，通过独立评估服务和高效工具提升评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为多模态研究提供一个全面、灵活且高效的评估工具，以促进模型性能的准确分析。

comprehensively assess multimodal models across a diverse range of
vision-language understanding and generation tasks, such as visual question
answering, text-to-image/video generation, and image-text retrieval. We
decouple model inference from evaluation through an independent evaluation
service, thus enabling flexible resource allocation and seamless integration of
new tasks and models. Moreover, FlagEvalMM utilizes advanced inference
acceleration tools (e.g., vLLM, SGLang) and asynchronous data loading to
significantly enhance evaluation efficiency. Extensive experiments show that
FlagEvalMM offers accurate and efficient insights into model strengths and
limitations, making it a valuable tool for advancing multimodal research. The
framework is publicly accessible athttps://github.com/flageval-baai/FlagEvalMM.

### [7] [AVA-Bench: Atomic Visual Ability Benchmark for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09082)
*Zheda Mai,Arpita Chowdhury,Zihe Wang,Sooyoung Jeon,Lemeng Wang,Jiacheng Hou,Jihyung Kil,Wei-Lun Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVA-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在解耦14种原子视觉能力（AVAs），以更精准评估视觉基础模型（VFMs）的性能，避免传统VQA基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA基准测试存在数据分布不匹配和多能力耦合的问题，导致无法准确评估VFMs的真实能力。

Method: 提出AVA-Bench，通过解耦14种原子视觉能力（如定位、深度估计等），并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，以精准评估VFMs。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现较小的LLM（0.5B）在评估中与较大LLM（7B）效果相似，但效率更高。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs的发展提供了全面透明的评估基础。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

### [8] [BakuFlow: A Streamlining Semi-Automatic Label Generation Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09083)
*Jerry Lin,Partick P. W. Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BakuFlow是一种半自动标注工具，通过像素级手动修正、交互式数据增强、标签传播和自动标注模块，显著提升计算机视觉任务的标注效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模计算机视觉任务中手动标注耗时且易出错的问题。

Method: 结合可调节放大镜、交互式数据增强、标签传播和基于改进YOLOE的自动标注模块。

Result: 显著减少标注工作量，提升效率，适用于动态和工业场景。

Conclusion: BakuFlow为对象检测和跟踪任务提供了高效、灵活的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

### [9] [Bias Analysis in Unconditional Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09106)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Michelle Lin,Simon Lacoste-Julien,Aaron Courville,Yash Goyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI模型中偏见的机制，发现偏见检测对属性分类器敏感，并呼吁改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI模型中偏见的产生机制，尤其是无条件生成中的偏见问题。

Method: 训练一组无条件图像生成模型，采用常用偏见评估框架分析训练与生成分布间的偏见偏移。

Result: 实验显示偏见偏移较小，且偏移对属性分类器敏感，尤其是在高密度区域。

Conclusion: 需改进标签实践、深入评估框架，并考虑属性的社会复杂性以更准确评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

### [10] [CAIRe: Cultural Attribution of Images by Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09109)
*Arnav Yayavaram,Siddharth Yayavaram,Simran Khanuja,Michael Saxon,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIRe是一种新的评估指标，用于衡量图像生成模型在不同文化背景下的表现，解决了现有方法在测量文化偏见方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在不同文化背景下的公平性能至关重要，但现有方法在测量和缓解文化偏见方面存在不足。

Method: 提出CAIRe框架，通过知识库和事实信息对图像中的文化标签进行独立分级评估。

Result: CAIRe在手动构建的数据集上比基线方法高出28% F1分数，并在两个数据集上与人类评分的相关性分别为0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能够有效评估图像生成模型的文化相关性，并与人类判断高度一致。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化技术CREPA，用于改进视频扩散模型的微调，提升视觉保真度和帧间语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户级微调视频扩散模型以反映训练数据特定属性存在挑战且研究不足，而现有方法如REPA在图像扩散模型中表现良好，但直接应用于视频模型时帧间语义一致性不足。

Method: 提出Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA)，通过将帧的隐藏状态与相邻帧的外部特征对齐，优化视频扩散模型的微调效果。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Hunyuan Video等大规模视频扩散模型上验证，CREPA显著提升了视觉保真度和帧间语义一致性。

Conclusion: CREPA是一种广泛适用的正则化技术，能有效改进视频扩散模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

*Mojtaba Nafez,Amirhossein Koochakian,Arad Maleki,Jafar Habibi,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchGuard提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的对抗鲁棒异常检测与定位方法，通过引入伪异常样本和定位掩码，显著提升了在对抗环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据仅包含正常样本而易受对抗攻击，PatchGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用前景感知伪异常样本和ViT架构，结合新颖的损失函数进行对抗训练。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上，PatchGuard在对抗环境下AD性能提升53.2%，AL提升68.5%。

Conclusion: PatchGuard在对抗和非对抗环境下均表现出色，为异常检测与定位提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

TL;DR: UFM模型通过统一训练在密集图像对应任务中表现优异，优于专用方法，速度快且误差低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集图像对应问题，统一宽基线场景和光流估计任务，提升匹配性能。

Method: 使用简单的通用Transformer架构，直接回归(u,v)流，避免传统粗到细成本体积方法。

Result: UFM比最先进光流方法（Unimatch）准确率高28%，比宽基线匹配器（RoMa）误差低62%，速度快6.7倍。

Conclusion: 统一训练在密集对应任务中优于专用方法，为多模态、长距离和实时任务开辟新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and
HR-Pairs dataset can be found in https://github.com/CVEO/MSSDF.

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Result: 8B模型在单H100上实现24fps、736x416分辨率的实时视频生成，或在8xH100上实现1280x720分辨率。

Conclusion: AAPT方法在效率和交互性上优于现有方法，适用于长视频生成。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to

Motivation: 传统图像分割方法（如边缘检测和变分方法）已被广泛研究，而深度学习方法需要大量训练数据。本文旨在提出一种不依赖大数据集且理论扎实的分割方法。

Method: 通过微分同胚变换将模板曲线变形为图像分割结果，利用LDDMM框架和变分损失函数（基于图像梯度场和几何形状的varifold表示）指导曲线演化。

Result: 该方法在Python中实现，通过PyKeops库进行GPU加速，实现了精确且灵活的图像分割。

Conclusion: 提出的变分框架结合了形状分析和微分同胚变换，为图像分割提供了一种理论扎实且无需大数据集的方法。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种语义增强擦除方法，通过循环自检和自擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，同时结合全局-局部协作保留机制，提升扩散模型的安全生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但预训练中包含的敏感信息可能导致安全风险，如不安全内容生成和版权侵权。现有方法将不安全概念视为固定词反复擦除，导致模型陷入“词概念深渊”，无法实现广义概念擦除。

Method: SAGE通过语义增强擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，利用语义空间关系探索和擦除概念域边界表示；同时提出全局-局部协作保留机制，结合全局语义对齐和局部噪声保留，减少无关概念的保留退化。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在扩散模型的安全生成方面全面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义增强擦除和全局-局部协作保留机制，有效解决了扩散模型中的安全生成问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Conclusion: ScaleLSD是首个在各方面超越传统非深度LSD的深度方法，显著提升了线几何的通用性。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding
and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images. Code and Models

Conclusion: 实验表明，该方法在新视角合成和分割任务中达到了统一3D场景与语义场重建的最先进性能。

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can
be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.
Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene
and semantic field reconstruction.

Result: 实验验证了ORBench的先进性和实用性，ReID5o模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: ORBench和ReID5o为OM-ReID研究提供了理想平台和解决方案。

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet
this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called
Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet-1k数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种模型的OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整先验几何能有效纠正不良分布样本的影响，提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Motivation: 解决源自由域适应（SFDA）中目标域无标签图像监督不足的问题，同时满足隐私保护和数据访问限制的需求。

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA通过提升伪标签质量和可靠性感知训练，有效解决了SFDA的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

Motivation: 现有方法（如BEV或稀疏点）在3D场景理解中存在局限性：BEV对小物体信息丢失严重，稀疏点对大物体建模效率低。

Method: 采用双分支设计：基于查询的稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息，最终融合输出3D占用预测。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: ODG通过结合BEV和稀疏点的优势，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在生成紧密交织的图像-文本输出时表现不佳，主要因训练数据规模、质量和指令丰富度不足。

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为多模态系统的进步提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 轻量级Transformer结合知识蒸馏和边缘感知增强，有效解决了计算成本和细粒度特征提取问题。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: HAM有效整合多源信息，显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在三个跨场景高光谱分类任务中，该方法性能接近最先进的领域适应方法，且无需训练时访问目标领域数据。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合多种技术，有效解决了开放集领域泛化问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

Conclusion: Urban1960SatBench和Urban1960SatUSM为利用现代计算机视觉研究长期城市变化提供了新工具。

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在存储成本上存在不足，且传统压缩方法因架构不兼容无法适用。

Method: TinySplat结合了View-Projection Transformation（VPT）减少几何冗余，Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction（VABR）减少感知冗余，并使用视频编解码器处理空间冗余。

Result: 实验显示，TinySplat实现了100倍以上的压缩比，存储大小仅为现有方法的6%，编码时间减少75%，解码时间减少99%。

Conclusion: TinySplat为3D场景重建提供了一种高效且紧凑的解决方案，显著提升了存储和计算效率。

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

Conclusion: 方法可推广至其他压缩任务，如图像和视频压缩。

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

Conclusion: HAIF-GS为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输的3D高斯溅射压缩方法，显著减少高斯基元数量，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射技术需要大量冗余高斯基元，内存和渲染开销大，且现有压缩方法缺乏全局保真度保证。

Method: 通过最优传输视角将3D高斯溅射压缩建模为全局高斯混合减少问题，分两步优化几何表示和外观属性。

Result: 实验显示，仅用10%的高斯基元即可实现与原始方法相当的渲染质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS），并优于现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级神经渲染提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于任何3D高斯溅射流程。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了T2I对抗性补丁在物理世界中不同视角下的攻击效果，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出AngleRoCL方法，通过学习通用概念（文本嵌入）来生成具有角度鲁棒性的补丁。

Result: 实验表明，AngleRoCL显著提升了补丁的角度鲁棒性，攻击成功率在多个视角下保持较高水平。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I生成内容中文本概念与物理属性之间的关系，为角度鲁棒性补丁的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

Result: 在SUN RGB-D、ScanNetV2和KITTI数据集上分别取得9.3、3.3和0.19的性能提升。

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet通过几何表示显著提升3D物体检测性能，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19
AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset. The project page is available at:

Abstract: Road networks are crucial for mapping, autonomous driving, and disaster
response. While manual annotation is costly, deep learning offers efficient
extraction. Current methods include postprocessing (prone to errors), global
parallel (fast but misses nodes), and local iterative (accurate but slow). We
propose GLD-Road, a two-stage model combining global efficiency and local

Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically
reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art

Motivation: 现有评测基准忽视了在恶劣天气和复杂交通环境下对CoT推理过程的严格评估，因此需要专门设计一个评测基准来填补这一空白。

Method: AD^2-Bench通过覆盖多样恶劣环境的数据、支持多步推理的细粒度标注，以及专门设计的评测框架，评估MLLMs的CoT推理能力。

Result: 对现有先进MLLMs的评测显示，准确率低于60%，表明该基准的难度和提升空间。

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench为自动驾驶领域提供了一个标准化评测平台，推动MLLMs推理能力的提升，是重要的研究资源。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat实现了几何-外观-语义的联合建模，提升了3D场景理解的准确性和连贯性。

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉故事生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Conclusion: HSENet通过高效3D视觉表示和语义对齐，显著提升了3D医学图像的理解和诊断能力。

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DGAE有效解决了高压缩比下的性能问题，同时为扩散模型提供了更紧凑的潜在表示。

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step
reasoning and belief persistence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在推理时改进视觉语言模型（VLM）组合性的方法，通过分割图像和文本并匹配片段，无需训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双编码器视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在组合性任务上表现不佳，而推理时技术的研究较少。本文旨在通过简单的推理时结构调整提升性能。

Method: 方法包括：1) 将图像分割为小块；2) 提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系）；3) 使用VLM匹配图像块与文本片段；4) 聚合相似度得分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种数据集上显著提升了VLM的组合性性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理时技术具有潜力，图像分割是关键改进点，未来可进一步优化推理方法。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

TL;DR: FasterSNN是一种混合神经架构，结合了生物启发的LIF神经元和区域自适应卷积与多尺度脉冲注意力，用于高效、稀疏处理3D MRI数据，以提升阿尔茨海默病（AD）的诊断效率和稳定性。


<details>

Motivation: 早期诊断AD（尤其是轻度认知障碍阶段）面临主观评估和多模态成像成本高的挑战，现有深度学习方法能效低且计算需求大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出FasterSNN，整合LIF神经元、区域自适应卷积和多尺度脉冲注意力，优化3D MRI数据的处理效率和稳定性。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FasterSNN表现出竞争性性能，同时显著提升效率和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: FasterSNN为AD筛查提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集多关注家庭环境，缺乏真实工业场景的数据，限制了方法在工业应用中的评估。

Method: 引入CHIP数据集，包含七种不同椅子，使用三种RGBD技术捕捉，并自动标注6D姿态。

Result: 基准测试显示现有方法在CHIP数据集上仍有显著改进空间，尤其是面对遮挡和干扰物时。

Conclusion: CHIP为工业环境中的6D姿态估计提供了新基准，未来研究可基于此进一步优化方法。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Motivation: 解决rPPG在长期个人护理场景（如高海拔环境）中因光照变化、遮挡和动态面部姿势带来的挑战。

Method: 使用240个同步RGB和红外面部视频数据集（LADH），结合多任务学习提升生理信号监测性能。

Result: RGB和红外视频结合将心率估计的平均绝对误差降至4.99 BPM，多任务学习同时提升多项生理指标。

Conclusion: LADH数据集和融合方法为长期非接触式生理监测提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Motivation: 微表情识别因持续时间短和强度低而更具挑战性，现有方法未能充分利用多源先验知识。

Method: 设计了基于I3D和坐标注意力机制的双编码器（GFE和AFE），并提出了两种变体MPFNet-P和MPFNet-C，分别对应平行和分层处理模式。

Conclusion: MPFNet通过多源先验知识融合显著提升了微表情识别性能，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign是一种简单通用的校准方法，能有效解决扩散模型中的像素-文本对齐问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Result: 实验结果表明，CSCF在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，有效解决了MMHCL任务。

Conclusion: CSCF通过跨模态信息融合和类别相似性优化，成功解决了多模态异构类别集学习的挑战。

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

Result: 在公开基准数据集和CS-UAV数据集上验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下有效提升了无人机绝对定位的精度。

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2的计算和内存消耗高，限制了其在资源受限场景的应用，因此需要一种高效的量化方法。

Method: Q-SAM2采用线性层校准和量化感知训练（QAT）来优化量化过程，抑制异常值并适应量化阈值。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2不仅适用于量化感知训练，其校准技术在后训练量化中也有效，显著提升了SAM2的实用性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大量任务特定训练数据的问题，探索是否可以通过预训练模型实现高效准确的6D姿态估计。

Method: 采用稀疏特征提取、特征感知评分机制和模块化设计，支持多实例分割模型集成。

Result: 在BOP Benchmark上实现新SOTA，速度提升8倍，准确性提高5%；集成模型下准确性再提升8%，速度仍快2.5倍。

Conclusion: FreeZeV2证明了无需任务特定训练即可高效准确估计新物体6D姿态，获BOP Challenge 2024最佳方法奖。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward

their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,

meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新型的多模态微表情数据集MMME，首次同步采集了面部动作信号、中枢神经系统信号和外周生理信号，显著提升了微表情识别和检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情研究仅依赖单一视觉模态，忽略了其他生理模态传递的丰富情感信息，导致性能不足。因此，探索视觉特征与生理信号的跨模态关联机制，开发多模态融合框架至关重要。

Method: 研究构建了MMME数据集，包含634个微表情、2,841个宏表情和2,890组同步多模态生理信号，并通过实验验证其可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，结合生理信号显著提升了微表情的识别和检测性能，MMME是目前模态多样性最全面的微表情数据集。

Conclusion: MMME为探索微表情的神经机制和视觉-生理协同效应提供了关键数据支持，推动了微表情研究从单模态视觉分析向多模态融合的范式转变。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset
will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理真实世界动态场景的复杂性，DynaSplat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合变形偏移统计和2D运动流一致性分类静态与动态元素，采用分层运动建模处理全局和局部运动，并引入基于物理的不透明度估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DynaSplat在准确性和真实感上超越现有方法，且更高效紧凑。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了一种更直观、高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用导航代理OctoNav-R1，通过多模态自由指令完成任务，并设计了OctoNav-Bench基准和Think-Before-Action数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航研究分散在不同任务/能力中，缺乏通用性。本文旨在开发能处理多模态、多能力自由指令的通用导航代理。

Method: 提出OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，构建基于MLLMs的OctoNav-R1模型，采用三阶段混合训练范式（HTP）。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过TBA-SFT和Nav-GPRO设计，提升了模型的推理能力，为通用导航代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Wasserstein距离的损失函数，通过对齐字符频率分布提升手写文本识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写文本识别因字符集的时变性和上下文依赖性而具有挑战性，现有模型在特定子集上表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一种新损失函数，利用Wasserstein距离惩罚预测文本与目标字符频率分布的差异，并作为评分函数在推理时提升模型性能。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多数据集和架构下有效提升了泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: 通过字符分布对齐，显著提升了手写文本识别的准确性和鲁棒性，且无需重新训练即可改进现有模型。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at
https://github.com/pkaliosis/fada.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估模型对直观物理原则（如永久性、不变性等）的理解能力，以填补当前模型与人类认知之间的差距。

Method: 基于违反期望框架设计测试，评估模型在虚拟环境中区分可能和不可能事件的能力。

Result: 现有模型在复杂场景中表现接近随机（50%），远低于人类近乎完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型在直观物理理解上的不足，呼吁改进模型架构和训练方法。

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures
and training methodologies.

Result: 在领域泛化和开放词汇识别中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Vireo为动态多样化环境提供统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、无需标注的微调框架Geometric Distillation，通过注入几何线索提升预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的3D空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需提升其几何感知能力。

Method: 利用现成的3D基础模型（如MASt3R、VGGT）提取稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，通过蒸馏注入预训练VLM。

Result: 在3D视觉语言推理和感知基准测试中表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Geometric Distillation为2D训练的VLM提供了一种高效扩展3D理解的路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: 数据驱动范式在新视角合成中具有潜力，减少3D知识依赖是可行的。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索胶囊网络在姿态感知表示中的固有优势，避免依赖专用预测器实现等变性。

Method: 引入EquiCaps，利用胶囊网络的姿态感知能力，结合多几何变换任务和3DIEBench-T数据集进行验证。

Result: EquiCaps在旋转预测任务中优于现有方法，R²达0.78，并在复杂变换下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 胶囊网络架构在姿态感知任务中具有潜力，且无需专用预测器即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$
of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE
and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to
non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule
architectures.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了方法的优异性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-FPN-BS通过有效利用高层语义信息，显著提升了小目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid
networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors
under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic
representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

Result: 在多样实例中显著优于现有方法，实现无内容泄漏的稳健风格一致性。

Conclusion: Only-Style方法有效解决了内容泄漏问题，同时保持了风格一致性，并提供了可量化的评估框架。

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

Result: 在四个HSI数据集上，聚类精度分别提升了2.61%、6.06%、4.96%和3.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进特征提取和拓扑图优化，显著提升了HSI聚类的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出LEO-VL模型，基于高效场景表示CFG，解决了3D-VL通用模型的数据扩展性问题，并在多个任务上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够理解3D场景并执行自然语言指令的3D-VL通用模型是长期目标，但现有模型在能力和鲁棒性上落后于2D模型，主要障碍是数据扩展性问题。

Method: 提出LEO-VL模型，采用CFG（压缩特征网格）作为高效场景表示，减少计算开销，并收集70万高质量3D-VL数据用于训练。

Result: LEO-VL在多个3D问答基准测试（如SQA3D、MSQA、Beacon3D）上取得最优性能，验证了CFG的高效性和数据多样性重要性。

Conclusion: LEO-VL和SceneDPO目标为3D-VL通用模型的扩展性和鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

*Aaron Foss,Chloe Evans,Sasha Mitts,Koustuv Sinha,Ammar Rizvi,Justine T. Kao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalVQA是一个用于视频问答（VQA）的基准数据集，专注于模型对物理世界中因果关系的理解，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集多关注表面感知或模拟环境中的狭窄物理推理问题，缺乏对真实场景中因果关系的深入探究。

Method: CausalVQA包含五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预期、规划和描述性），并通过质量控制机制防止模型利用简单捷径。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在基准测试中表现显著低于人类，尤其在预期和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解及预测能力上的不足，为未来研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Motivation: 点云数据的尺度多样性对统一表示学习技术提出了挑战，目前缺乏适用于对象和场景级点云的统一预训练方法。

Method: 提出UniPre3D，预测高斯基元作为预训练任务，使用可微分高斯渲染实现像素级监督和端到端优化，并整合2D特征以引入纹理知识。

Result: 通过多种对象和场景级任务的实验验证了方法的普适有效性。

Conclusion: UniPre3D是首个适用于任何尺度和架构的统一预训练方法，实验证明了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Motivation: 扩展视觉问答任务到视频对话场景，要求模型不仅识别视觉信息，还需结合外部知识和对话上下文。

Method: 构建了一个包含2017个视频和5986个对话的数据集，标注了40954个对话轮次，并提供了基线模型。

Result: 数据集公开可用，基线模型展示了任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: 该任务需要模型结合视觉信息和外部知识，未来研究需进一步解决相关挑战。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in
natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework
trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks
simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing
number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to
computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more
diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist
models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field.
First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing
research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their
performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a
brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections
and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application
scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and
offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

Result: 数据集支持标准VQA性能和模型鲁棒性评估，为临床场景提供更具挑战性的基准。

Conclusion: Kvasir-VQA-x1旨在加速开发更可靠的多模态AI系统，并遵循FAIR数据原则，为研究社区提供资源。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过视觉绘图操作增强大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）空间推理能力的新范式，显著提升了模型在多种空间推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯文本推理，难以处理需要精确几何理解和连续空间跟踪的任务。

Method: 通过赋予模型基本绘图操作（如标注边界框和绘制辅助线），并结合三阶段训练框架（冷启动训练、反射拒绝采样和强化学习），实现视觉空间中的直接推理。

Result: 模型VILASR在多种空间推理任务中平均提升18.4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过视觉绘图操作直接推理的方法有效突破了文本中心化推理的局限性，为LVLMs的空间推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Result: 在多种输入图像（如人脸、绘画和照片）上实现了高保真和优质笔触的绘画效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域化策略和语义引导，显著提升了绘画的艺术性和笔触质量。

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够生成高质量、可编辑的3D对象，解决了部分融合和可变部分数量的挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

Conclusion: ReSim模型能够可靠模拟多样化驾驶场景，填补了高保真模拟与奖励信号需求之间的差距。

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法仅能全局控制单一主体，无法满足多概念交互场景的需求，限制了应用范围。

Method: 利用掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并通过迭代方式将局部音频条件注入对应区域，实现布局对齐的多模态匹配。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多模态条件下的显式布局控制优于隐式方法和其他现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效提升了多概念人类中心视频的可控生成质量。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

Method: 引入MVP基准，包含55K个高质量多选题视频QA样本，每个样本配有视觉相似但答案相反的最小变化对。

Result: 人类表现92.9%，最佳开源模型40.2%，随机表现25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准能有效避免模型依赖表面线索，更准确评估物理理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Conclusion: EditInspector为文本引导编辑的评估提供了有效工具，新方法显著提升了评估性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Motivation: 探索如何通过声音增强3D场景的交互体验，特别是模拟人手与物体交互时的声音。

Method: 录制人手操作3D场景中物体的视频，利用动作-声音对训练修正流模型，将3D手部轨迹映射到对应音频。测试时，用户可通过手部姿势序列查询模型生成声音。

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，TeReDiff在文本识别准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架有效解决了文本图像幻觉问题，提升了图像修复的文本保真度。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自我中心视角下动态环境模拟和视频生成的挑战，为世界建模及其应用开辟新方向。

Method: 采用粗到细训练流程，先在大规模文本-视频对上预训练，再通过自动构建的同步运动-视频数据微调，设计了部分解耦的运动注入方案和联合重建框架。

Result: 实验表明PlayerOne能精确控制不同人体运动并实现多样场景的世界一致性建模。

Conclusion: PlayerOne是自我中心真实世界模拟的首创，为世界建模及其应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation
and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world
modeling and its diverse applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的简单框架，用于运动插值任务，强调数据建模选择的重要性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有运动插值方法依赖复杂模型，本文旨在探索简单但高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用单一Transformer编码器，重点优化数据建模（如数据量、姿态表示和速度特征）。

Result: 数据建模选择显著提升性能，挑战了模型复杂度决定动画质量的假设。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的方法在运动插值中具有潜力，模型复杂度并非唯一关键因素。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a
video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,
roughness, metallic) from the generated video. Finally, we use the intrinsics
alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly
extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.

TL;DR: TransGI是一种新型神经渲染方法，用于实时高保真全局光照，通过对象中心的神经传递模型和辐射共享照明系统实现高效渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时渲染中材料表示紧凑性和表达性的挑战，支持动态光照条件下的高质量渲染。

Method: 采用基于MLP的解码器和顶点附着潜在特征的对象中心神经传递模型，结合局部光探针和辐射共享策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，每帧渲染时间少于10毫秒，渲染质量显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TransGI在实时渲染中实现了高质量和高效性能，为动态光照条件下的神经渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural rendering algorithms have revolutionized computer graphics, yet their
impact on real-time rendering under arbitrary lighting conditions remains
limited due to strict latency constraints in practical applications. The key
challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation.
To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for
real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric
neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing
lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations
and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring
thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely,
real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse
materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves
compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached
latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For
dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing
scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for
efficient probe generation. We implemented our method in a real-time rendering
engine, combining compute shaders and CUDA-based neural networks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance of less than
10 ms to render a frame and significantly improved rendering quality compared
to baseline methods.

Result: DGS-LRM在动态重建质量上媲美优化方法，优于现有预测方法，且适用于3D跟踪任务。

Conclusion: DGS-LRM在动态场景重建和跟踪任务中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具主要用于定量分析（如数值评分），缺乏对NLG系统具体问题的深入定性分析。

Method: 方法包括两步：开放式实例问题分析和直观累积算法聚类问题，并引入评估策略和人工标注数据验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在2/3的情况下能正确识别实例问题，并能生成与人工标注相似的问题类型报告。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge为NLG系统提供了有效的定性评估工具，帮助开发者改进系统。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

Motivation: 探索深度神经网络（尤其是生成式卷积神经网络）能否从词汇学习中提取语音学泛化规律，并研究全连接层瓶颈缩小对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 训练生成式卷积神经网络（CNNs）处理原始音频波形，缩小全连接层（FC）瓶颈至8通道，并提出一种新方法：绕过FC输入随机特征图生成音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，卷积层能够动态泛化语音学依赖关系，即使绕过FC，生成的音频输出仍受训练数据中语音学限制的影响。

Conclusion: 卷积层具备动态泛化语音学规律的能力，而全连接层的窄瓶颈设计有助于揭示这种泛化机制。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注毒性内容检测，而亲社会行为的识别同样重要但缺乏数据和模型。

Method: 结合无监督发现与游戏领域专家协作，提出SAAM模型，利用整个训练集作为“锚点”提升性能。

Result: 在《使命召唤：现代战争II》中验证了方法的有效性，首次实现了游戏聊天中亲社会行为的自动分类。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线平台从单纯惩罚毒性转向鼓励积极互动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖行为测试或计算块识别，未能深入分析模型推理的神经活动，导致无法准确评估self-NLE的忠实性。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，以定量测量其忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并建立了self-NLE与模型推理之间的直接联系。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了对self-NLE忠实性的理解，并为生成更忠实的self-NLE奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

Motivation: 比喻语言在人类交流中普遍存在，但现有理论（如RSA框架）无法有效解释比喻表达或需要特定情境建模说话者动机。

Method: 引入$(RSA)^2$框架，通过建模说话者的修辞策略来解释比喻语言，无需动机建模，并结合LLMs。

Result: $(RSA)^2$在讽刺解释数据集PragMega+上实现了最佳性能，且能生成与人类兼容的非字面解释。

Conclusion: $(RSA)^2$为比喻语言提供了一种无需动机建模的解释方法，结合LLMs在任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效检测AD，还揭示了模型对AD语言模式的学习能力，为模型解释和数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

Result: LLMs展现出一定的协作推理能力，为构建人机混合系统提供了基础。

Conclusion: LLMs具备初步的心智理论能力，未来可推动人机无缝协作的发展。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

TL;DR: RePO通过利用多样化的回放策略从回放缓冲区中检索离策略样本，显著提升了大型语言模型的优化效率，相比GRPO在性能和计算效率上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO方法在优化大型语言模型时计算成本高且数据效率低，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出RePO方法，利用回放缓冲区中的离策略样本进行策略优化，以增加样本多样性。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，RePO显著提升了模型性能，同时计算成本仅增加15%，但有效优化步骤增加48%。

Conclusion: RePO是一种高效且性能优越的优化方法，适用于大型语言模型的强化学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在小语言模型中，结合旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）的半秩潜在多头注意力（MLA+RoPE）能显著减少内存占用（45%），同时性能损失极小（0.3%），并提升推理速度1.4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小语言模型中潜在多头注意力（MLA）的效率与性能权衡，以优化内存受限场景下的部署。

Method: 训练30M参数的GPT模型，对比标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA及MLA+RoPE三种架构，分析其内存、速度和性能表现。

Result: MLA+RoPE（r=d/2）在减少45%内存的同时，性能接近MHA（损失仅0.3%），推理速度提升1.4倍，并在GPT-4评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE是小语言模型的理想选择，尤其在内存受限场景下，实现了效率与性能的帕累托改进。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVE是一种多样性增强的重构方法，通过领域亲和性挖掘、基于剪枝的专家重构和高效重训练，显著降低了MoE LLM的训练开销，同时保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重构方法忽视了专家多样性，导致冗余。本文基于剪枝后LLM在不同校准数据集上的多样性观察，提出DIVE方法以提升效率。

Method: DIVE包括领域亲和性挖掘、剪枝重构FFN模块，以及对路由器、专家和归一化模块的高效重训练。

Result: 实验表明，DIVE在相同激活参数数量下，优于现有剪枝和MoE重构方法，实现了高效训练且准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: DIVE通过多样性增强重构，显著提升了MoE LLM的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

TL;DR: COGENT是一个面向课程的框架，用于生成适合年级的教育内容，解决了生成式AI在教育中的挑战，如课程对齐和阅读水平控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用存在挑战，如难以符合课程标准和保持年级适当的阅读水平，尤其是在STEM教育中。

Method: COGENT结合科学概念、核心思想和学习目标，通过长度、词汇和句子复杂度控制可读性，并采用“基于好奇”的方法提升学生兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，COGENT生成的文本在年级适应性上优于或等同于人工参考内容。

Conclusion: COGENT为扩展自适应和高质量学习资源提供了可行方法。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅限于分类任务，无法生成详细的说话人特征或上下文丰富的描述，特别是人口统计属性（如方言、性别、年龄）的结构化捕捉。

Method: CoLMbo整合了说话人编码器和基于提示的条件，利用用户定义的提示动态适应新说话人特征，生成定制化描述。

Result: CoLMbo在增强传统说话人分析的同时，在零样本场景下表现出色，适用于多样化数据集。

Conclusion: CoLMbo在说话人识别领域实现了显著进步，提供了更丰富、灵活的说话人描述能力。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

Motivation: 在线新闻的泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，因此需要自动区分其质量。

Method: 使用115个语言特征和二元标签（基于专家共识）评估了12种模型，包括传统集成方法和深度学习模型。

Result: 传统集成方法（如bagging分类器）表现良好（88.1%准确率），而微调的DistilBERT准确率最高（90.3%）。

Conclusion: NLP特征与深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，但需权衡预测性能和训练时间。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能像人类一样根据上下文灵活使用礼貌策略，平衡信息传递和社交目标。

Method: 通过约束性和开放性任务比较人类与LLMs的回应，分析其礼貌策略使用情况。

Result: 大模型（≥70B参数）能复制人类礼貌偏好，但在正面情境中过度依赖负面策略，人类评价者却更偏好LLM生成的回应。

Conclusion: LLMs在礼貌策略上表现优异，但细微差异引发了对AI系统语用对齐的思考。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实课堂中的知识追踪通常面临数据稀疏和需要在线更新的挑战，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 利用层次化知识概念信息，提出基于隐马尔可夫树模型的KT$^2$框架，通过EM算法估计学生掌握程度，并支持增量更新。

Result: 实验表明，KT$^2$在低资源在线设置中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过层次化知识结构和增量更新机制，有效解决了低资源知识追踪问题。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

Motivation: LLM在多选题问答中表现优异，但对输入扰动高度敏感，需提升其在噪声环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TCD算法，通过token级预测对齐增强鲁棒性，并结合提示工程优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TCD显著恢复性能退化，尤其对较弱模型提升达39%。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用、模型无关的方法，可提升LLM在现实不完美条件下的推理稳定性，为其在安全关键或用户交互应用中的可靠部署铺路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGQA方法在多样性和多跳推理样本上存在不足，传统数据增强方法易导致语义失真，而基于LLM的方法则忽视多跳推理。

Method: PGDA-KGQA采用提示设计范式，通过生成单跳伪问题、语义保留的问题重写和答案引导的反向路径探索来增强训练数据。

Result: 在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上，PGDA-KGQA在F1、Hits@1和准确率上分别提升了2.8%、1.2%、3.1%和1.8%、1.1%、2.4%。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过多样化的数据增强策略显著提升了KGQA的性能，尤其在多跳推理和语义对齐方面表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world

Motivation: 解决SFT导致LLMs通用能力下降及灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 重构基础模型的指令分布，筛选数据并与新数据混合进行SFT。

Result: 实验显示方法在保持通用能力的同时提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 新方法有效平衡通用能力与任务适应性。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解人类心理状态（ToM）方面存在挑战，需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: UniToMBench整合了1,000多个手写场景的数据集，结合视角采择技术和多样化评估指标。

Result: GPT-4o等模型在情感和信念相关任务中表现优异（准确率>80%），但在知识型任务中表现不稳定。

Conclusion: UniToMBench是评估和改进LLMs心理理论能力的全面工具，突显了当前模型的优势和局限。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出POET方法，通过截断偏好与非偏好响应至等长，解决DAAs中的奖励-生成差距问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAAs（如DPO和SimPO）在训练与推理目标间存在奖励-生成差距，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出POET方法，截断响应至等长，优化DAAs目标，关注前缀标记。

Result: POET在AlpacaEval 2上提升15.6分，下游任务表现全面改善。

Conclusion: 解决奖励优化与生成性能的不匹配对DAAs至关重要。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

Motivation: 自杀是西方国家的主要死因之一，社交媒体数据为研究自杀行为提供了新视角。

Method: 采用计算自下而上、混合和专家驱动的自上而下方法，分析181个自杀未遂者和134个对照者的YouTube频道数据。

Result: 发现五个与自杀未遂相关的主题，其中两个随时间变化显著；专家未识别的平台特定指标（如YouTube互动）具有价值。

Conclusion: 综合方法提供了对自杀行为的深入理解，连接了数字行为与临床认知。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

Motivation: LLM性能评估的复现性对研究至关重要，但现有方法未充分考虑硬件和数值精度的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验分析不同硬件、软件和精度设置下模型输出的差异，并提出LayerCast框架。

Result: 实验显示GPU配置和精度设置可导致高达9%的准确率差异和9000个token的响应长度变化。

Conclusion: 数值精度对LLM复现性影响显著，LayerCast框架有效平衡了内存与稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（RoPE），解决了Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM）在位置编码上的不兼容问题，并设计了一种混合架构（model），显著提升了训练和推理速度以及准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在长序列建模中各有优势，但两者的位置编码机制不兼容（Transformer依赖显式旋转位置嵌入，SSM依赖隐式卷积表示），导致性能下降。

Method: 提出统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（RoPE），并基于此设计了一种混合架构（model），将Transformer和SSM层整合在同一位置编码框架下。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，model的训练和推理速度分别比标准Transformer快42.3%和29.5%，语言建模任务中准确性提升超过4%，且扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 统一的位置编码解决了混合模型中的位置不兼容问题，实现了高效且高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Conclusion: ReasonMed数据集和训练策略显著提升了LLMs在医学问答中的性能。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常依赖单一知识源，缺乏认知启发的知识激活机制。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG性能优于传统RAG（提升3.8%至13.8%）。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种高效且通用的增强模块，适用于基于语料的RAG方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human

multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion

Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引发关注。

Method: 研究使用GendEL数据集（240个句子）分析性别偏见，并测试GPT-4o作为缓解工具的效果。

Result: 发现MT系统在性别明确时表现良好，但在未指定性别时缺乏包容性；GPT-4o能生成更多性别中立选项。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在缓解性别偏见方面有潜力，但仍存在残余偏见。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs,
categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在训练过程中记忆数据的机制，尤其是潜在结构（如ID）如何调节记忆行为，以解决隐私和知识产权泄露问题。

Method: 通过分析内在维度（ID）作为序列潜在结构复杂性的几何代理，研究其对记忆行为的调节作用，重点关注过参数化模型和稀疏暴露条件下的表现。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更难被记忆，尤其是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露条件下，ID成为抑制记忆的信号。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型规模、数据暴露和序列复杂性在记忆行为中的交互作用，为理解语言模型的记忆机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

TL;DR: 比较信息论概率预测器与朴素判别学习（NDL）预测器在声学词长建模中的表现，发现N-gram模型优于NDL模型，但信息论公式能提升NDL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨信息论与NDL在声学词长建模中的效果差异，挑战NDL因认知动机更有效的假设。

Method: 使用Buckeye语料库比较三种模型：信息论公式NDL、传统NDL和N-gram概率预测器。

Result: N-gram模型表现最佳，但信息论公式能提升NDL性能。

Conclusion: 需结合频率、上下文预测性和信息论指标，优化声学缩减建模。

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语数据集稀缺且规模小，限制了手语翻译模型的性能。

Method: 采用骨架生成、拼接和两种生成模型（SignGAN和SignSplat）生成多样化的手语数据。

Result: 数据增强方法显著提升手语翻译模型性能，最高达19%。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的手语翻译系统提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出RAPL框架，通过结合启发式信号与参数化模型、模型无关的图转换方法以及基于路径的推理策略，显著提升了知识图谱问答（KGQA）中的检索效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱问答中存在知识过时和幻觉问题，检索增强生成（RAG）虽能缓解但依赖非结构化文本，限制了可解释性和结构化推理。知识图谱提供了更结构化的替代方案，但现有方法在泛化能力上仍有不足。

Method: RAPL框架包含三部分：1) 两阶段标注策略结合启发式信号与参数化模型；2) 模型无关的图转换方法捕捉三元组内和间的交互；3) 基于路径的推理策略支持结构化输入。

Result: RAPL在KGQA任务中优于现有方法2.66%-20.34%，显著缩小了不同规模LLM推理器之间的性能差距，并提升了跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAPL通过结构化检索和推理策略，有效提升了知识图谱问答的检索能力和泛化性，为LLM与知识图谱结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

our pipeline and identified the challenges that are still present in this
field. During the evaluation phase of the competition, our solution achieved an

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过查询级别不确定性检测知识边界的方法，旨在无需生成任何标记即可判断模型是否能回答给定查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要明确其知识边界，以便进行自适应推理（如调用RAG或采用弃权机制），这对开发高效可信的AI至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的‘内部置信度’方法，利用跨层和跨标记的自我评估来检测知识边界。

Result: 在事实问答和数学推理任务上的实验表明，该方法优于多个基线。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于高效RAG和模型级联，在保持性能的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLMs）的无结构化知识编辑（UKE）方法，解决了现有方法在局部性评估和微调（FT）异常失败方面的问题，并通过实验验证了FT-UKE方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无结构化知识编辑（UKE）对于更新大语言模型的知识至关重要，但现有方法缺乏局部性评估且微调方法表现异常。

Method: 构建了两个数据集（UnKEBench-Loc和AKEW-Loc），并通过实验分析了影响FT方法性能的四个因素，提出了优化的FT-UKE方法。

Result: FT-UKE方法在单次和批量编辑场景中均优于现有最优方法，性能优势随批量增大而提升。

Conclusion: FT-UKE方法在无结构化知识编辑任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了有效的训练方案。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法多为启发式且缺乏概率基础，需要更可靠的理论支持。

Method: 提出双随机游走视角，将输入-输出对建模为两个马尔可夫链，并基于语义相似性定义转移概率。

Result: 实验表明，Inv-Entropy优于现有语义不确定性量化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且有效，为LLM的不确定性量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code
to reproduce the results can be found at

Motivation: AI生成内容的工作流定制需要专业知识，ComfyUI-R1旨在降低用户学习门槛，实现自动化工作流生成。

Method: 使用4K工作流数据集构建长链推理数据，通过CoT微调和强化学习训练7B参数模型。

Result: 模型在格式有效性、节点级和图级F1分数上显著优于GPT-4o和Claude系列。

Conclusion: ComfyUI-R1展示了长链推理在AI艺术创作中的潜力，特别是在复杂工作流合成中的优势。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

Motivation: 通过评估LLMs的反应行为是否类似人类，探索其在教育测试开发中作为试点参与者的潜力，以加速测试开发。

Method: 基于心理测量学的经典测试理论和项目反应理论，使用公开数据集评估LLMs在阅读、美国历史和经济学三个科目中的表现。

Result: 较大模型反应过度自信，但经温度校准后更接近人类；LLMs在阅读理解题中与人类相关性较高，但整体相关性不强。

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本设置下不适合用于教育测试的试点评估。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中效率低且不准确，直接结合代码解释器效果不佳。

Method: 通过Hint-Engineering合成代码集成推理数据，结合监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习，对1.5B至32B参数的模型进行后训练。

Result: 在五个数学推理数据集上，模型性能提升4%至8%，计算开销减少30%至50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效提升了LRMs与CI的交互效率，为复杂数学推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注图像语义与文本叙事的匹配，忽略了图像来源的准确性，导致误判。

Method: 构建了News Media Provenance Dataset，设计了LOR和DTOR两项任务，并测试了六种LLM的零样本性能。

Result: LOR任务表现良好，但DTOR任务表现不佳，显示需要进一步优化。

Conclusion: 未来需开发专门架构以提升DTOR任务的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Result: 在数学和常识推理基准测试中，显著提高了推理效率并减少了token使用，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升大型语言模型的推理性能和成本效益提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需外部知识的鲁棒、可扩展的幻觉检测解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）逐渐发展出一个核心语言无关参数空间，支持跨语言的抽象思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs以英语为‘思考’语言的假设，探索其多语言性能背后的机制。

Method: 识别语言相关神经元（共享或独占），并分析其在不同语言中的激活模式。

Result: 发现共享神经元比例和功能重要性随时间增加，构成核心语言无关参数空间。

Conclusion: 提出针对不同发展阶段LLMs的神经元特定训练策略，实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估个性化任务导向助手的复杂性，因此需要开发更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入PersonaLens基准，包含多样化用户配置和两个LLM代理（用户代理和法官代理），用于评估个性化、响应质量和任务成功率。

Result: 实验显示当前LLM助手在个性化能力上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: PersonaLens为提升对话AI系统的个性化能力提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

Motivation: 在线购物中，海量评论使消费者难以手动总结主要观点，因此需要自动化意见摘要系统。现有方法在生成基于方面的摘要时存在挑战。

Method: 提出ASESUM框架，从产品关键方面提取观点，并衡量其显著性和有效性，无需预定义方面集。

Result: 实验表明，ASESUM在捕捉原始评论的多样化观点方面优于现有和新方法。

Conclusion: ASESUM能够有效生成基于方面的摘要，适应不同领域，且性能优越。

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合规则代码验证和LLM验证的RL方法VerIF，用于提升指令跟随能力，并在实验中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在指令跟随任务中的最佳实践尚未充分探索，验证工程是关键挑战。

Method: 提出VerIF方法，结合规则代码和LLM验证，构建高质量数据集VerInstruct，并应用于RL训练。

Result: 模型在多个指令跟随基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力强，且不影响通用能力。

Conclusion: VerIF可整合到现有RL流程中，提升模型性能，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

TL;DR: 论文提出QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER，通过聚焦查询的注意力机制提升长上下文检索性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索头（retrieval heads）在长上下文语言模型中表现有限，需改进以提升检索效率。

Method: 通过聚合输入查询的注意力分数识别QRHEAD，并开发QR-RETRIEVER作为高效检索器。

Result: 在LongMemEval和CLIPPER任务中性能提升超10%，BEIR基准测试中零样本表现优于RankGPT。

Conclusion: QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER为通用检索器提供新思路，并增强了对长上下文能力的理解。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

TL;DR: Resa是一种通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）高效训练1.5B推理模型的方法，显著降低训练成本和时间，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地激发语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中提取推理能力，并通过监督微调将这些能力转移到目标模型中。

Result: SAE-Tuning在仅1美元成本和20分钟内，保留了97%的RL训练性能，并在轻量RL训练模型上表现出色。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，且方法高效低成本。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在社交媒体上检测AI生成文本的挑战，尤其是在攻击者不公开其微调模型的情况下，检测效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是网络影响力活动的重要攻击渠道，AI生成的大量帖子可能被用于支持或反对特定政策或事件，因此检测这些内容至关重要。

Method: 研究团队以威胁行为者的视角，创建了一个包含505,159条AI生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，涵盖11个争议话题，并测试了不同检测算法的效果。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，检测效果大幅下降，人类研究也证实了这一结果。

Conclusion: 微调模型对检测算法构成普遍威胁，这对所有检测领域都有重要影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上达到最高准确率，且无幻觉或污染。多语言微调还提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 分步推理策略在大语言模型解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

Motivation: 在线有毒语言对缺乏审核工具的地区造成实际伤害，研究旨在探索如何在这些低资源语言中有效检测毒性内容。

Method: 构建并手动标注了4500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型（GPT-3.5 Turbo、GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro、Claude 3 Opus）在零样本和上下文增强模式下的表现。

Result: 上下文增强模式平均提升召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10；Gemini在上下文增强模式下表现最佳（F1=0.82，准确率=0.82），GPT-4.1在零样本模式下精度最高。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计和阈值校准，可以在低资源语言中显著提升毒性检测效果，为巴尔干语言社区提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核器通常基于完整输出进行检测，导致高延迟；而部分检测方法直接应用全检测训练的模型，存在性能下降问题。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集，提出流式内容监控器（SCM），采用响应和标记级双重监督训练。

Result: SCM仅需查看响应前18%的标记即可达到与全检测相当的F1分数（0.95+），并能提升安全对齐效果。

Conclusion: SCM是一种高效的实时有害内容检测方法，同时可作为伪标注器提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法通常局限于单词或局部文本的修改，忽略了上下文，导致扰动可检测或语义不一致。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡模型误导和文本自然性。

Result: 实验表明，DCP能有效挑战现有NLP模型的鲁棒性，生成更自然的对抗样本。

Conclusion: DCP强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的重要性，为构建更鲁棒的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DAVSP显著提升对恶意查询的防御能力，同时保持良性输入性能。

Conclusion: DAVSP通过视觉安全提示和深度对齐的协同作用，实现了更深的模型对齐和跨模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across
various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit
the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist
malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To
address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),
which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety
Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It
preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we
propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt
through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent
ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than
prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative
LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while
preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model
generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety
Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its
overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at

little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前重建方法仅依赖单一先验或物理模型，难以解决高度不适定的逆问题，导致结果不理想。

Method: LoREIN通过低秩表示（LRR）和隐式神经表示（INR）结合低秩先验和连续性先验，优化空间基并提升加权图像重建质量。

Result: 该方法实现了高保真度的加权图像重建，并提升了定量参数图的准确性。

Conclusion: LoREIN为零样本学习范式提供了潜力，推动了医学影像领域的进步。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further

Motivation: 早期准确检测脑部异常（如肿瘤和中风）对及时干预和改善患者预后至关重要。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（MobileNet V2和ResNet-50）通过迁移学习对MRI图像进行分类，并采用数据增强和dropout层防止过拟合。

Result: 模型训练准确率达93%，验证准确率达88%，ResNet-50表现略优，但MobileNet V2在资源有限环境下更具潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为早期脑部异常检测提供了实用的AI解决方案，具有临床部署潜力，未来可通过更大数据集和多模态输入进一步优化。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and
strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In
this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both
brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages.
We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural
networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to
classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and
augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to
ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and
prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation.
The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\%
and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly
better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time
diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This
research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality
detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement
through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.

Motivation: 传统组织病理学诊断在资源匮乏地区难以普及，而口腔细胞刷活检结合AI可提供低成本、微创的替代方案。

Method: 收集并标注了来自印度十个医疗中心的PAP和MGG染色口腔细胞学切片数据，用于训练高容量AI模型。

Result: 该数据集填补了公开口腔细胞学数据的空白，支持AI驱动的诊断方法开发。

Conclusion: 该资源有望提升自动化检测、减少诊断错误，改善全球OSCC早期诊断和患者预后。

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden,
particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where
it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection
dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent
survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited
accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive,
resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral
cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost
alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability
and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial
intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access
to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that
generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter
oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with
Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten
tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by
expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is
designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in
publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance
automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis
in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality
and better patient outcomes worldwide.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示（INRs）在计算机视觉和计算成像中表现出强大潜力，但其在逆问题中的样本复杂性尚不明确，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 通过拟合具有ReLU激活和傅里叶特征层的单隐藏层INR，结合广义权重衰减正则化，研究图像恢复的采样需求。

Result: 研究发现，通过解决INR训练问题，可以精确恢复由INR实现的图像，并确定了所需的傅里叶样本数量。

Conclusion: 论文验证了INRs在连续域图像超分辨率恢复中的性能，为INRs在逆问题中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs
represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network
taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel
representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating
images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,
we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image
from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with
ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight
decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this
non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex
penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a
sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is
exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our
theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of
images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the
performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom
images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏长尾安全关键场景，限制了自动驾驶系统的测试效果。

Method: 提出Adv-BMT框架，利用双向运动变换器（BMT）逆向预测交通运动，分两阶段生成对抗性交互场景。

Result: 生成的碰撞场景质量高，实验显示使用增强数据集可将碰撞率降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT能有效生成多样且真实的碰撞场景，提升自动驾驶系统测试效果。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Motivation: 现有的事件相机检测方法使用密集事件表示，但噪声积累问题未得到充分关注，导致表示质量下降和漏检率增加。

Method: 提出WD-DETR网络，包括密集事件表示、小波去噪方法、基于变换器的目标预测网络，以及动态重组卷积块（DRCB）以减少推理时间。

Result: 在DSEC、Gen1和1Mpx数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX上实现约35 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: WD-DETR网络有效解决了事件相机检测中的噪声问题，并实现了高效的实时感知。

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的感知评估指标PCD，用于量化自动驾驶系统中物体可靠检测的最远距离，并考虑了模型输出的不确定性。同时，发布了SensorRainFall数据集，支持不同天气条件下的感知性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的感知性能受物体距离、场景动态和环境条件（如天气）影响，传统静态评估指标无法捕捉置信度的波动。

Method: 提出PCD指标，结合SensorRainFall数据集（包含白天晴朗和雨天场景的精确数据），通过统计分析检测置信度方差的变化点，并计算平均PCD（mPCD）。

Result: 实验表明，mPCD能捕捉不同天气条件下的感知可靠性差异，而静态指标则无法做到。

Conclusion: PCD为感知性能提供了分布感知的评估方法，支持更安全、更稳健的自动驾驶系统运行，SensorRainFall数据集为评估提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the
evaluation code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: UAD提供了一种无需人工标注的可操作性学习方法，展示了在复杂场景中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，抓取透明和反射物体的成功率提高了44%。

Conclusion: DCIRNet有效解决了透明和反射物体的深度估计问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

Abstract: The robust interpretation of 3D environments is crucial for human-robot
collaboration (HRC) applications, where safety and operational efficiency are
paramount. Semantic segmentation plays a key role in this context by enabling a
precise and detailed understanding of the environment. Considering the intense

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

Motivation: 目前，医生需要从双平面透视图像中重建和预测导管运动，负担较重，现有跟踪方法不适用于神经介入中的微导管。

Method: 在导管上布置定制不透射线标记物，并提出设计准则以减少标记物跟踪不确定性的敏感性。

Result: 在直径小于2mm的微导管上部署该方法，形状跟踪误差小于1mm，导管滚动误差低于40度。

Conclusion: 该方法可实现导管在双平面成像下的自主导航。

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，实现了全局到局部的动作约束，并在多个任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅预测下一步动作，缺乏对全局目标的约束。CoA 旨在通过反向推理和任务目标驱动的动作链式思考，提升策略的空间泛化能力和任务完成效率。

Method: CoA 采用自回归结构，首先生成任务目标的关键帧动作，随后基于关键帧和已预测动作逐步生成后续动作。通过连续动作表示、动态停止、反向时间集成和多令牌预测等技术实现高效轨迹生成。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中均达到最优性能，表现出强大的空间泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoA 通过反向推理和全局约束，显著提升了视觉运动策略的性能和泛化能力，为复杂任务提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异大，缺乏统一评估标准，因此需要一种LLM无关、非参数化且可解释的威胁模型。

Method: 构建基于1T tokens的N-gram语言模型，用于评估攻击是否可能发生在文本分布中，并适配流行攻击方法进行基准测试。

Result: 发现现代安全调优模型的攻击成功率低于预期，离散优化攻击显著优于基于LLM的攻击，有效攻击利用罕见bigrams。

Conclusion: 提出的威胁模型为越狱攻击提供了可解释的比较框架，揭示了攻击成功的关键因素。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型中记忆与泛化的关系，发现模型容量与学习模式之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索记忆与泛化在大型语言模型中的关系，以理解模型容量如何影响学习行为。

Method: 通过预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，设计字符级任务分别测试泛化和记忆能力。

Result: 小模型能泛化但无法记忆，大模型能记忆但无法泛化；中等容量模型倾向于记忆；联合训练时所有模型均无法泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练可能固有地偏向某种学习模式，研究为小语言模型的设计提供了启示。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架通过事实抽象和LLM模拟提升了在线决策能力，展示了经验积累的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Method: 提出InstructPro模型家族，包括InstructPro-1B和InstructPro-3B，通过自然语言指令和配体SMILES公式生成蛋白质序列。开发了训练策略和大规模数据集InstructProBench。

Result: InstructPro-1B和InstructPro-3B在对接成功率和RMSD上均优于基线模型，其中InstructPro-3B的平均RMSD降至2.527Å。

Conclusion: InstructPro展示了根据功能描述生成配体结合蛋白质的能力，为蛋白质设计提供了高效的新方法。

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI计算基础设施的高成本和LLM部署中的隐私问题，企业需要一种既能保护敏感数据隐私又不影响模型效用的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种随机、序列依赖的词嵌入变换方法，理论分析了其与高斯混合模型互信息的关系，并通过实验验证了隐私和性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护输入数据隐私的同时，保持了LLM的标准性能。

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform是一种有效的隐私保护方法，适用于共享或多租户计算环境中的LLM部署。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能过程奖励模型通常需要大量时间和资金投入，且传统自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）易产生噪声标签且计算成本高。

Method: 提出利用弱完成者和强完成者之间预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的生成标准，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略优化模型性能。

Result: Athena-PRM在多个场景和基准测试中表现出色，仅需5000样本即可实现高效性能提升，并在多个任务中超越现有最优结果。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM在评估推理步骤正确性和奖励排名微调方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了模型性能，为复杂推理问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Motivation: LLMs能准确描述概率分布但生成样本时存在偏差，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 引入Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)，通过自然语言提示LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其在温和假设下优于直接采样。

Conclusion: VRS展示了如何将经典概率工具嵌入LLM工作流以提高可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态基础模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实证指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

Motivation: 解决长期天气预报中稳定性和物理一致性的挑战，验证标准经纬度网格是否足以实现长期稳定预测。

Method: 引入AtmosMJ，一种直接在ERA5数据上运行的深度卷积网络，采用GRF机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ能稳定预测约500天，10天预报精度与Pangu-Weather和GraphCast相当，且训练成本极低。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计是长期稳定天气预报的关键，非标准数据表示并非必需。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中表现出色，但其特征纠缠问题导致难以提取鲁棒且可解释的表示。因此，需要一种方法能够分离类别定义特征与无关上下文。

Method: 提出CLAReps（Canonical LAtent Representations）作为潜在代码，保留核心类别信息并去除无关信号。基于CLAReps开发了CaDistill框架，通过教师-学生模式进行特征蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，CaDistill框架仅需10%的训练数据即可显著提升学生的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，使其更专注于类别信号而非无关背景线索。

Conclusion: CDMs不仅可以作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑且可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习的发展。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Method: 使用BERT语言模型作为自动说话人验证系统，分析VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge数据集中的文本内容。

Result: 平均等错误率（EER）为35%，部分说话人EER低至2%；系统决策与语义相似关键词相关。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑依赖全局EER进行隐私评估的合理性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了可学习特征提取前端的正则化方法，通过音频扰动和STFT域掩码改进，缩小了与传统方法的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经前端在ASR系统中表现不如传统方法，主要原因是过拟合问题。

Method: 研究了音频扰动方法，并提出STFT域掩码改进SpecAugment。

Result: 结合两种正则化方法，显著提升了可学习特征的性能。

Conclusion: 通过正则化方法，可学习特征与传统方法的性能差距得以缩小。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

TL;DR: CryoSPIRE是一种基于高斯混合模型的新型3D重建框架，用于处理冷冻电镜图像中的非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化，显著提升了复杂实验数据的解析能力。


<details>

Motivation: 冷冻电镜（Cryo-EM）在分子生物学中具有革命性意义，但如何建模非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化的分子结构仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种分层高斯混合模型框架（CryoSPIRE），通过部分分割提供归纳偏置，以处理构象和组成变化。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据中揭示了生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench基准测试中达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜图像的非刚性和组成变化建模提供了高效解决方案，推动了该领域的技术进步。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出UTGenerator和UTBoost框架，通过LLM生成测试用例以解决SWE-Bench中测试不足的问题，并纠正了大量错误标记的补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE-Bench中手动编写的测试用例不足，导致生成的补丁即使未解决问题也能通过测试。

Method: 引入UTGenerator（基于LLM的测试用例生成器）和UTBoost（测试用例增强框架），自动分析代码库和依赖关系生成测试用例。

Result: 在评估中，纠正了345个错误标记的补丁，影响了SWE-Bench的排行榜排名。

Conclusion: UTGenerator和UTBoost能有效提升测试用例质量，显著改善代码生成评估的准确性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard
entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.

TL;DR: Ming-Omni是一个统一的多模态模型，支持处理图像、文本、音频和视频，并在语音和图像生成方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多模态模型需要单独模型或任务特定调整的问题，实现高效的多模态输入处理和融合。

Method: 使用专用编码器提取多模态标记，结合MoE架构和模态特定路由器，集成音频解码器和图像生成模块。

Result: 实验证明Ming-Omni在统一感知和生成任务中表现优异，支持多种功能如语音生成和图像编辑。

Conclusion: Ming-Omni是首个开源支持多模态的模型，匹配GPT-4o，并公开代码和权重以促进研究。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

Result: 人机协作系统在复杂任务中表现优于独立AI，更具信任度和适应性。

Conclusion: AI发展的目标不应是独立性，而是如何更好地与人类协作，未来AI应增强人类能力而非取代人类。

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为意图分解生成（IFG）的方法，通过将采样过程分为意图生成和最终生成两阶段，提升大语言模型输出的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在提升多样性时往往仅停留在词汇层面，导致推理问题探索不足和对话重复。IFG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: IFG分两阶段采样：首先生成语义密集的意图（如摘要或关键词），然后基于原始提示和意图生成最终响应。意图阶段使用高温以促进多样性，生成阶段使用低温确保一致性。

Result: 实验表明，IFG在数学和代码任务中提升了pass@k和强化学习性能，在对话任务中增加了多样性且未牺牲奖励，同时在通用语言建模任务中保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: IFG是一种简单有效的方法，通过调整提示和温度即可提升大语言模型样本的多样性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

Motivation: 解决现代AI通过观察学习和理解世界的挑战。

Method: 预训练无动作的联合嵌入预测架构V-JEPA 2，结合大规模语言模型，并应用于机器人规划任务。

Result: 在多项任务中取得领先性能，如运动理解（77.3 top-1准确率）和视频问答（84.0 PerceptionTest得分）。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合少量机器人数据可生成能规划物理世界的世界模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

Motivation: 确保任务导向LLM代理在严格政策环境下的一致性，同时保持自然交互，并抵御恶意用户行为。

Method: 提出CRAFT多代理红队系统，利用政策感知策略测试代理鲁棒性；引入tau-break基准评估代理抗操纵能力。

Result: CRAFT在客服场景中优于传统越狱方法；现有防御策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 需更强研究驱动的保护措施以抵御对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

Motivation: 现有LLM方法生成的查询扩展过于狭窄，忽略了探索和多样性需求。

Method: 提出ThinkQE框架，包含基于思考的扩展过程和语料交互策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkQE有效解决了查询扩展中的探索和多样性问题。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like
ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is
applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial
capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net
loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates
normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the

paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari

equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum

methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音基础模型（如OWSM）在大规模数据集上训练，但对罕见和未见词汇的识别仍不理想。现有的CB方法因缺乏预训练知识而性能较低。

Method: 论文将现有CB方法与OWSM v3.1结合，冻结预训练参数，利用SFM的嵌入知识实现有效CB。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LibriSpeech 100测试集上，偏置词错误率（B-WER）降低了11.6点，整体WER提升0.9点，实时因子减少7.5%。

Conclusion: 通过结合CB与预训练SFM，该方法显著提升罕见词汇识别性能，同时保持模型效率。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean

transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich
Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across
dimensions, ensuring effective feature transformation. Experiments on
LibriSpeech and FLEURS datasets show MKL-VC significantly improves content
preservation and robustness with short reference audio, outperforming kNN-VC.
MKL-VC achieves performance comparable to FACodec, especially in cross-lingual
voice conversion domain.
