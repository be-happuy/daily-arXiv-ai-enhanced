### [1] [EfficientQuant: An Efficient Post-Training Quantization for CNN-Transformer Hybrid Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11093)
*Shaibal Saha,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientQuant是一种针对混合模型的结构感知后训练量化方法，显著降低延迟且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模型在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但资源消耗大，边缘部署受限。现有后训练量化方法对混合模型效果有限。

Method: 采用统一量化处理卷积块，对数量化处理Transformer块。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上实现2.5×-8.7×延迟降低，精度损失极小，边缘设备上表现高效。

Conclusion: EfficientQuant为混合模型的边缘部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

### [2] [Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133)
*Christos Pantazopoulos,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从2D关键点输入估计3D手部关节的优化流程，无需相机参数知识，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单张彩色图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和复杂关节结构。

Method: 采用关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失函数，避免对相机参数的依赖。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，对“野外”图像具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 方法在无需相机参数的情况下表现良好，但2D关键点估计精度对结果影响显著。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

### [3] [Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122)
*Divya Swetha K,Ziaul Haque Choudhury,Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan,Biswajit Brahma,Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合ESRGAN和Faster R-CNN的方法，用于从低分辨率图像中提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像中目标检测性能不佳的问题，适用于图像质量不一致的应用场景。

Method: 使用ESRGAN作为预处理步骤增强图像质量，再通过Faster R-CNN进行目标检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像质量受限的场景下提供了更鲁棒和可靠的目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

### [4] [Technical Report for Argoverse2 Scenario Mining Challenges on Iterative Error Correction and Spatially-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11124)
*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAV框架通过LLM将自然语言查询转换为可执行代码以挖掘自动驾驶场景，但面临代码错误和参数理解不准确的问题。本文提出迭代代码生成和专用提示工程两项改进，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的代码运行时错误及复杂空间关系参数理解不准确的问题，以提高场景挖掘的可靠性。

Method: 1. 引入容错迭代代码生成机制，通过错误反馈重新提示LLM优化代码；2. 采用专用提示工程改进LLM对空间关系函数的理解和应用。

Result: 在Argoverse 2验证集上实验表明，系统性能显著提升，使用Gemini 2.5 Pro时HOTA-Temporal得分达52.37。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度，为自动驾驶系统开发提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [5] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于StarDist算法的创新图像测量方法，用于铁矿石颗粒的分类和质量检测，解决了传统方法在密集和不稳定环境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如ViT、Mask R-CNN等）在铁矿石颗粒分类和质量检测中效果不佳，需要更精确的方法来识别和分析复杂环境中的对象。

Method: 采用StarDist算法进行对象分割、轮廓确定和分类，并测量物理尺寸，特别关注颗粒的大小分布和质量分类。

Result: 开发了一种新方法，能够检测边界平滑的对象，显著提高了物理尺寸测量的准确性和颗粒大小分布的分析精度。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法，本研究为铁矿石颗粒的分类和测量提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

### [6] [Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131)
*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT是一种高效的图像分割模型，通过聚焦输入图像和可变分辨率补丁标记化减少计算成本，同时保持模型大小不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高图像分割的效率，避免通过减小模型规模来实现效率提升，同时保持性能。

Method: 采用聚焦输入图像和可变分辨率补丁标记化技术，减少图像标记数量。

Result: STT在分割任务中效率更高且性能有竞争力，可在消费级硬件上实时运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种适用于增强现实或机器人应用的高效分割工具。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

### [7] [Gender Fairness of Machine Learning Algorithms for Pain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11132)
*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于面部表情的自动疼痛检测模型在不同性别群体中的公平性，发现尽管ViT模型准确率最高，但所有模型均存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索机器学习和深度学习模型在疼痛检测中的性别公平性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 方法包括比较传统ML算法（L SVM和RBF SVM）与DL方法（CNN和ViT），使用多种性能和公平性指标评估模型。

Result: 结果显示ViT模型准确率最高，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见。

Conclusion: 结论强调在自动医疗系统中需要采用公平性技术以减少偏见，平衡准确性与公平性。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

### [8] [ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134)
*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ContextLoss（CLoss）的新型损失函数，通过考虑临界像素掩码中的拓扑错误及其上下文，提高了图像分割的拓扑正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构（如血管、膜或道路）的拓扑结构至关重要，因为拓扑错误（如道路网络中的错误）会严重影响导航。

Method: 提出了CLoss损失函数，利用临界像素掩码中的上下文信息来改善拓扑错误，并设计了两种直观的指标来验证连通性的改进。

Result: 在三个公共数据集（2D和3D）及自有的3D纳米成像数据集上测试，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss显著提高了拓扑正确性，代码已公开。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

### [9] [JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11136)
*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级、灵活的特征上采样器，可将基础视觉编码器的低分辨率特征提升到任意目标分辨率，无需高分辨率监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率特征输出需要上采样以满足下游任务的高分辨率需求，现有方法效果有限。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，通过空间特征变换（SFT）调制，将高分辨率查询与语义丰富的低分辨率键对齐。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，在多种下游任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR在无需高分辨率监督的情况下，实现了高效的特征上采样，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何利用基于大型语言模型（LLM）的Agentic AI方法，通过自然语言提示自主构建计算机视觉系统，并在医学图像分析中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Agentic AI在计算机视觉任务中的潜力，特别是通过自然语言提示自主规划和配置工具，减少对数据科学家的依赖。

Method: 扩展开源Cognitive AI环境SimpleMind，结合LLM代理（OpenManus），实现从自然语言提示到任务分解、工具配置的自动化流程。

Result: 代理成功生成YAML配置文件，并在50张胸部X光片上实现自主训练和测试，平均Dice分数为肺部0.96、心脏0.82、肋骨0.83。

Conclusion: 研究表明Agentic AI能够自主完成计算机视觉应用的规划和工具配置，具有替代传统数据科学家工作的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

### [11] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性感知动态加权、自适应类别平衡和轻量级对比正则化，有效利用未标记数据并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督语义分割方法存在伪标签利用不足、类别不平衡偏差加剧和预测不确定性忽视等问题，限制了模型性能。

Method: 框架包含四个核心组件：模糊伪标签（保留软类别分布）、不确定性感知动态加权（基于熵的可靠性评分）、自适应类别平衡（动态调整损失）和轻量级对比正则化（优化特征嵌入）。

Result: 在基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有最优方法，尤其在少数类和模糊区域的分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，该框架有效解决了半监督语义分割中的关键挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual
workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version
does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

*Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Wang Liao,Jiaqi Yang,Zerong zheng,Weihong Zeng,Han Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman框架通过偏好优化和分治策略优化人类视频生成，提升运动自然性和视觉保真度，同时减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类视频生成在运动自然性和视觉保真度之间存在权衡，需要一种方法同时优化这两个目标。

Method: 提出AlignHuman框架，结合偏好优化和分治策略，利用时间步分段偏好优化（TPO）和专家对齐模块（LoRAs）分别优化运动动态和保真度。

Result: 实验表明，AlignHuman显著提升基线性能，推理时间减少3.3倍（从100 NFEs降至30 NFEs），且生成质量影响极小。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过时间步分段优化和专家模块，有效解决了运动自然性与保真度的权衡问题，同时提升了效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无标记数据的情况下从脑电信号中恢复心理目标的问题，此前的研究依赖标记数据或预训练解码器。

Method: 提出CURSOR算法，通过自校准方法从未标记数据中学习，预测图像相似度分数并生成新刺激。

Result: 实验表明，CURSOR能预测与人类感知判断相关的相似度分数，并生成与心理目标无法区分的新图像。

Conclusion: CURSOR首次实现了无标记数据下的心理目标恢复，为脑机接口和认知研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）自动生成多样化的视频描述句子，构建细粒度视频字幕基准MCTS-VCB，全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕评测基准存在关键点单一、数据创建成本高和评估范围有限等问题，亟需一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出AutoCaption框架，通过MCTS迭代生成多样化描述句子，覆盖视频细节，并构建MCTS-VCB基准。

Result: 在MCTS-VCB上评估20多个MLLMs，Gemini-1.5-Pro表现最佳（F1=71.2）；使用AutoCaption数据微调InternVL2.5-8B，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: AutoCaption和MCTS-VCB有效解决了现有评测问题，为MLLMs的视频理解能力提供了全面评估工具。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files
are interpreted through layout-aware libraries. The extracted raw text is
subsequently analyzed by an LLM to identify key-value pairs and resolve
ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced
flexibility and semantic precision across different document categories

Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情绪识别和社交动态）是一个重要但具挑战性的问题，现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法捕捉非语言线索的作用，而VLMs的潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出新任务“视觉社交-语用推理”，构建高质量数据集，并测试多种VLMs的表现。

Result: 发现VLMs存在视觉社交-语用推理缺陷，并通过实验验证了其局限性。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理中存在显著缺陷，需进一步研究以提升其能力。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and

Conclusion: 该方法通过无偏提示和测试时缩放，提高了LLM生成诊断的可靠性和分类准确性。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Conclusion: WaveFormer在轻量化和实时性上表现优异，适合嵌入式系统部署。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为恶劣场景下的无人机目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精准识别提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用改进的YOLOv11模型，训练了近800张鸟瞰图，识别车道和车辆类别（汽车和重型车辆）。

Result: 模型在测试中表现优异，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.97 mph，均方误差（MSE）为0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型在车辆速度检测和分类中表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个全球分布的森林地上生物量（AGB）估计数据集，用于评估地理空间基础模型（Geo-FMs）的性能，并展示了其在像素级回归任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集多局限于特定地理区域或任务类型，缺乏多样性。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供一个全球分布的数据集，以促进Geo-FMs的开发和评估。

Method: 结合EnMAP卫星的高光谱影像和GEDI激光雷达的AGB密度估计，构建了一个覆盖七大洲的数据集，并比较了Geo-FMs与基线U-Net的性能。

Result: 实验表明，Geo-FMs在某些情况下性能优于U-Net，尤其是微调编码器时。性能差异与区域数据集大小和Vision Transformer的token patch大小有关。

Conclusion: 通过发布这一全球数据集，论文推动了Geo-FMs在高光谱影像应用中的发展，并为研究地理偏见和模型泛化能力提供了工具。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有妇科腹腔镜手术数据集规模小、任务单一或标注不足，限制了其在全面、端到端工作流分析中的应用。

Method: 引入GynSurg数据集，提供丰富的多任务标注，支持动作识别、语义分割、手术文档记录和新手术见解发现。

Result: 通过标准化训练协议对先进模型进行基准测试，验证了数据集的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: GynSurg数据集的公开发布将加速妇科腹腔镜手术领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C-reweight的无失真水印方法，用于解决图像生成模型中的重标记不匹配问题，同时保持图像质量并提高可检测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成模型的快速发展，其潜在滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等）凸显了对强健真实性验证机制的需求。传统水印技术因重标记不匹配问题难以直接应用于图像生成模型。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，通过基于聚类的策略等效处理同一簇内的标记，以解决重标记不匹配问题，同时保持图像保真度。

Result: 在主流图像生成平台上的评估表明，C-reweight不仅保持了生成图像的视觉质量，还提高了可检测性，优于现有无失真水印技术。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准，有效解决了重标记不匹配问题。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于大规模高光谱数据。

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

Result: 模块可应用于任何多模态模型并取得先进结果，训练出的July模型在空间关系问答数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型对空间关系的理解和推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中常出现幻觉问题，生成输入图像中不存在的信息，影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，并应用偏好学习方法，专注于纠正特定目标区域的幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个视觉幻觉任务中有效减少了幻觉，提升了模型的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: \mymethod通过专注于相关信息的纠正，显著减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在骨骼连接预测上存在不足，无法直接保证拓扑准确性，因此需要一种新方法来自动化并优化骨骼连接关系。

Method: 采用连接保持标记化方案、拓扑感知奖励函数和隐式测地特征，结合奖励引导的优化策略。

Result: 生成的骨骼结构更符合解剖学，变形效果更优，显著减少了皮肤绑定中的常见问题。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过综合优化连接性和拓扑准确性，为自动绑定提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型依赖大规模文本-图像数据集，但数据来源可能涉及版权和隐私问题。现有审计方法依赖模型内部知识或评估不可靠，因此需要一种更实用的黑盒审计方法。

Conclusion: FSCA是一种高效且实用的黑盒审计框架，适用于真实场景，具有强大的审计潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）面临跨模态对齐的挑战，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识。

Method: TAViS引入文本桥接设计，包括伪文本提示机制和基于文本的对齐监督策略。

Result: TAViS在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过文本桥接设计有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 癌症亚型分类需依赖专家标注，但标注成本高且资源有限，因此需开发高效且不确定性感知的模型以减少标注需求。

Result: 仅需1-10%标注即可在基准数据集上实现最优性能，显著提升分类精度和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下具有显著优势，为数字病理学中的癌症亚型分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的车辆感知系统（V2LMs），相比传统深度神经网络（DNNs），在对抗攻击下表现出更强的鲁棒性，且无需对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）依赖的DNNs易受攻击，传统防御方法（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且难以泛化。

Method: 提出V2LMs，包括两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务），并评估其在对抗条件下的表现。

Result: V2LMs在对抗攻击下平均精度下降小于8%，而DNNs下降33%-46%。Tandem Mode在内存效率上更优。

Conclusion: V2LMs为AV感知系统提供了更安全、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME在现实取证和信息安全应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD假设查询和参考图像视角完全对齐，这在现实中不切实际。ECD旨在利用环境线索，避免不现实的视角对齐。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过利用多个参考候选和聚合语义丰富的表示来检测变化，解决了视角不对齐和有限视野覆盖的问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上评估，显著优于现有方法的简单组合，性能接近理想设置。

Conclusion: ECD为场景变化检测提供了更实用的解决方案，新框架在视角不对齐的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The
implementation is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过利用视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，改进无监督域适应（UDA）中的伪标签和目标提示学习，解决了现有方法中视觉嵌入分布偏离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型（如CLIP）在UDA中表现优异，但其伪标签机制存在视觉嵌入分布偏离的问题，导致误导信号。本文旨在通过几何关系优化伪标签和目标提示学习。

Method: 提出基于源提示的参考预测，利用视觉和文本嵌入的聚类特性，结合最优传输理论，设计新策略以增强目标域中的对齐。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和目标提示表示质量的改进。

Conclusion: 通过几何嵌入关系优化伪标签和目标提示学习，显著提升了UDA的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Manager插件，通过自适应聚合单模态专家的多层次知识，提升视觉-语言模型性能，并在Two-Tower和MLLM架构中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BridgeTower在单模态表示利用、语义知识灵活性和低分辨率数据集评估上的局限性。

Method: 引入ManagerTower，在跨模态层中嵌入Manager插件，自适应聚合单模态专家知识。

Result: 在4个下游任务中超越基线，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件和多网格算法协同提升视觉表示，缓解语义模糊，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的GNSS-惯性初始化策略，通过延迟使用全局GNSS测量数据，结合Hessian矩阵奇异值变化判断切换时机，显著提升了初始化的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台初始化时，有限的初始测量数据可能导致估计不准确，甚至陷入局部最优解，因此需要一种更有效的初始化方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于GNSS相对距离残差的初始化策略，通过分析Hessian矩阵奇异值的变化，动态决定何时切换到全局GNSS测量。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接使用全局GNSS数据的策略表现更优，初始化更准确和鲁棒。

Conclusion: 延迟使用全局GNSS测量并结合动态切换策略，能够显著提升初始化性能，避免局部最优解。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Motivation: 当前的后训练量化方法在视觉Transformer的低比特量化中仍存在显著精度下降问题，传统Hessian近似方法存在局限性。

Result: 在多种视觉任务和ViT架构上的实验表明，FIMA-Q显著提升了量化精度，尤其在低比特量化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q为视觉Transformer的后训练量化提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such
events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose
SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

Motivation: 旋转估计在计算机视觉和机器人任务中至关重要，但传统方法通常是非线性和非凸优化问题，设计复杂且难以处理。本文旨在提供一种更简单、更鲁棒的方法。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中的时空动态性和预训练模型限制使得自由能量引导的自修复机制难以直接应用。

Method: 提出EyeSimVQA框架，采用双分支结构（美学分支和技术分支），结合自由能量自修复模块和生物启发的预测头。

Result: 在五个公共VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能优于或与现有方法相当，同时提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA通过创新的设计和生物启发方法，为VQA提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时间推理上表现不足，限制了其在特定视频时刻的精确响应能力。

Method: 采用Temporal-aware Fuseformer分层双流架构，结合全局残差设计，并通过四阶段渐进训练范式提升多模态对齐、语义基础和时序推理能力。

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO表现优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，需量化分析视觉线索提取和推理过程对性能的贡献。

Method: 开发了基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑流程，精确修改视觉线索；构建VFaith-Bench基准，通过编辑图像生成对比问题对，测试模型推理能力。

Result: VFaith-Bench包含755个条目和额外人工标注任务，测试主流模型后发现其推理能力与视觉感知密切相关。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了MLLMs推理能力与视觉信息的关联，为未来模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 未来可通过增加数据集或图像增强方法进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Conclusion: OV-MAP方法在无需3D监督的情况下实现了高精度的3D实例分割，适用于多样化的开放世界场景。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal

Conclusion: A$^2$LC在标签校正效率和性能上均显著优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估图像分类任务中公平性的新方法，特别针对肤色数据，避免传统分类的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肤色在计算机视觉中以张量数据表示，而非传统分类特征，现有公平性研究多关注分类特征（如性别、种族），忽略了肤色的特殊性。

Method: 将肤色数据转换为概率分布并应用统计距离度量，避免刚性分类；提出基于贝叶斯回归和多项式函数的训练方法以减少潜在偏差。

Result: 新方法能够捕捉传统分类中忽略的细微公平性差异，并在肤色处理上更公平。

Conclusion: 该方法为肤色公平性提供了更细致的评估和优化手段，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

*Emre Kavak,Tom Nuno Wolf,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM）和正则化策略DISCO，用于解决预测任务中模型依赖无关信号的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在预测任务中，模型可能依赖无关信号（如光照条件）而非真实因果信号，导致预测偏差。

Method: 提出SAM模型分析反因果设置中的信息路径，并设计DISCO正则化策略，通过条件距离相关性优化条件独立性。

Result: DISCO在不同偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代方案。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为减少预测任务中的无关信号依赖提供了有效工具。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线图像中违禁物品的外观与自然物体差异大，且遮挡严重，导致实例分割困难。

Method: 整合Segment Anything Model（SAM）和设计的遮挡感知双层掩码解码器，利用标注数据集PIDray-A和PIXray-A进行监督。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，数据集和代码已开源。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了X射线图像中违禁物品的实例分割问题，为安全检测提供了新工具。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态混合课程LoRA专家（D-MoLE）方法，用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的持续学习，通过动态调整架构解决任务冲突和模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用固定架构，难以适应新任务，且存在任务架构冲突和模态不平衡问题。

Method: 提出D-MoLE方法，包括动态分层专家分配器和基于梯度的跨模态持续课程，以动态调整架构和平衡模态更新。

Result: 实验表明D-MoLE显著优于现有基线，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 这是首个从架构角度研究MLLMs持续学习的工作，为解决任务适应性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉表示学习方法存在负样本选择不当、忽视局部细节和低层次特征的问题，影响了模型的性能。

Method: 提出CM-CGNS方法，包括跨模态k-means聚类改进负样本选择，以及跨模态掩码图像重建模块增强特征交互。

Result: 在五个下游数据集上的分类、检测和分割任务中，该方法在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能够学习到有效且鲁棒的医学视觉表示，适用于多种识别任务。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索气道相关影像生物标志物对肺纤维化患者生存结果的预测意义。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) 使用nn-Unet分割气道结构；2) 从气管和气道周围提取关键特征；3) 将特征输入SVM分类器。

Result: 分割任务得分为0.8601，分类任务得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在预测肺纤维化患者生存方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Motivation: 探索不同模型在人类动作识别任务中的表现差异，并分析其背后的原因。

Method: 使用COCO图像库的三类子集，比较了全连接网络、卷积网络、CLIP模型和ViT的性能，并通过SHAP和LeGrad进行可解释性分析。

Result: ViT的测试准确率最高（90%），显著优于其他模型（卷积网络约35%，CLIP模型约62-64%）。ANOVA分析证实差异显著（F=61.37, p<0.001）。可解释性分析显示ViT更关注动作相关区域。

Conclusion: Transformer在数据效率上表现优异，可解释性技术有助于诊断模型错误。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理多表格图像数据时表现不足，缺乏相关基准评估其能力。

Method: 提出MTabVQA基准，包含3,745个复杂问题-答案对，并开发MTabVQA-Instruct数据集用于微调模型。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在MTabVQA上表现有限，但通过微调显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: MTabVQA和MTabVQA-Instruct为提升视觉多表格推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Motivation: 现有方法依赖完整的模态假设，无法动态平衡贡献或处理模态缺失，导致在真实临床场景中表现不佳。

Method: DMAF-Net采用动态模态感知融合模块、关系与原型蒸馏框架，以及动态训练监控策略，优化模态贡献和特征对齐。

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态融合和蒸馏策略，显著提升了不完整多模态医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

Method: 提出MambaVSR框架，包含共享罗盘构造（SCC）和内容感知序列化（CAS）模块，动态建模时空交互；全局-局部状态空间块（GLSSB）结合窗口自注意力和SSM特征传播。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提升0.58 dB，且参数减少55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的内容感知机制和状态空间模型，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上表现优异，超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态多模型融合能有效解决异常检测的多面挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能家居活动识别系统因缺乏大规模多样化标注数据而难以泛化的问题。

Method: 通过虚拟数据生成管道AgentSense，利用大型语言模型生成多样化用户行为数据，并在模拟环境中记录传感器数据。

Result: 虚拟数据显著提升了模型性能，尤其在真实数据有限时，结合少量真实数据即可达到与全量真实数据相当的效果。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据能有效解决智能家居活动识别中大规模标注数据缺乏的挑战，无需人工数据收集。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Motivation: 等长运动因其便利性和隐私性受到欢迎，但缺乏专家指导可能导致姿势错误、受伤和用户流失。

Method: 发布了一个包含3600多个视频片段的多类别等长运动数据集，并评估了包括图网络在内的先进模型，提出了一种新的三部分评估指标。

Result: 研究结果提高了智能个性化家庭锻炼系统的可行性，并扩展了其在康复和物理治疗等领域的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该系统通过直接向用户提供专家级诊断，为家庭锻炼和相关领域提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL方法在超声心动图领域表现不佳，因样本相似性高、低PSNR输入敏感或增强失真临床特征。

Method: DISCOVR结合聚类视频编码器和在线图像编码器，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失传输知识。

Result: 在六个超声心动图数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测中优于现有方法，分割迁移表现优异。

Conclusion: DISCOVR在心脏超声视频表示学习中表现出色，解决了领域特定挑战。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效且有效的ViT量化框架，通过两阶段策略（先量化激活，再量化权重）显著提升了4位量化的性能，同时降低了计算成本和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PTQ和QAT方法在ViT量化中的局限性，如PTQ的精度下降和QAT的高计算成本、泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：第一阶段量化激活并保持权重为FP32，第二阶段量化权重。通过特征模仿损失和PTQ方法实现高效量化。

Result: GPLQ比现有QAT方法快100倍，内存占用低于FP32训练，4位量化模型在ImageNet和下游任务中表现接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ提供了一种高效、实用的ViT量化解决方案，显著提升了性能和效率，并计划开源工具包。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡的多语言微调策略。

Conclusion: 建立了VLT的新评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本3D目标检测提供了可行方案，适用于多种道路场景。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Motivation: 全景图像编辑因球面几何和投影变形存在边界不连续、轨迹变形和像素密度不均的挑战，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: SphereDrag采用自适应重投影（AR）处理边界不连续，大圆轨迹调整（GCTA）提高轨迹准确性，球形搜索区域跟踪（SSRT）解决像素密度不均。

Result: SphereDrag在几何一致性和图像质量上显著优于现有方法，相对提升达10.5%。

Conclusion: SphereDrag通过球面几何知识解决了全景图像编辑的关键问题，并构建了标准化评估框架PanoBench。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Result: 实验表明O2Former在SAR船舶数据集上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: O2Former通过针对性设计有效解决了SAR图像分割的挑战，具有较高的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务协同下实现了几何稳健的图像合成和明确的几何预测。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Motivation: 理解视觉-语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，目前机制尚不明确。

Method: 采用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征在LLM的中后层逐渐与语言表征对齐，揭示了ViT输出与早期LLM层之间的不对齐问题。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优地促进跨模态表征学习，提出了进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基线模型上，VGR在多模态基准测试中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，显著提升了多模态理解能力，尤其在需要细粒度图像理解的复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or

visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索术前身体组成指标对结肠切除术后结果的预测能力，以改善术后风险评估和管理。

Method: 使用Cox比例风险模型评估1年死亡率预测性能（C-index和IBS），逻辑回归评估次要结果（AUC和Brier Score），提取300多个CT特征。

Result: 研究分析了CT提取的肌肉面积、密度、脂肪面积等指标与术后结果的关联，并结合NSQIP评分进行评估。

Conclusion: 术前CT身体组成指标可能有助于预测结肠切除术后结果，为临床决策提供额外信息。

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

Motivation: 解决交互区域定位的挑战，包括细粒度部分定位、多有效交互区域的模糊性以及数据稀缺问题。

Method: 开发了Affogato大规模数据集（150K实例），并构建了基于预训练视觉主干和文本条件热图解码器的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: Affogato数据集和模型为解决交互区域定位问题提供了有效工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在多尺度渲染时存在锯齿问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入世界空间平滑核约束频率内容，并设计对象空间Mip滤波器进行抗锯齿处理。

Result: 显著提升不同尺度下的渲染质量，消除高频伪影。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，有效解决了2DGS的锯齿问题。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索射线重排序对现有GPU光线追踪实现的性能提升潜力，特别是与特定追踪内核无关的方法。

Method: 总结现有射线排序键计算方法，提出一种改进的终止点估计方法，适用于次级射线追踪，并在RTX内核中评估。

Result: 射线重排序在最新GPU上显著提升追踪速度（1.3-2.0倍），但硬件加速阶段的排序开销难以完全抵消。

Conclusion: 射线重排序能有效提升性能，但需进一步优化以解决排序开销问题。

Abstract: We study ray reordering as a tool for increasing the performance of existing
GPU ray tracing implementations. We focus on ray reordering that is fully
agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for
computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel
modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point
estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray
reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the
RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher
trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3-2.0x), but to recover the reordering overhead
in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.

Method: 利用四面体网格的特性（每个单元最多4个邻居）设计优化的GPU算法和数据结构。

Result: GPU实现性能提升30倍，支持32样本/像素的实时渲染。

Conclusion: 四面体网格是一种高效且适应性强的体积数据渲染解决方案。

Abstract: We advertise the use of tetrahedral grids constructed via the longest edge
bisection algorithm for rendering volumetric data with path tracing. The key
benefits of such grids is two-fold. First, they provide a highly adaptive
space-partitioning representation that limits the memory footprint of
volumetric assets. Second, each (tetrahedral) cell has exactly 4 neighbors
within the volume (one per face of each tetrahedron) or less at boundaries. We
leverage these properties to devise optimized algorithms and data-structures to
compute and path-trace adaptive tetrahedral grids on the GPU. In practice, our
GPU implementation outperforms regular grids by up to x30 and renders
production assets in real time at 32 samples per pixel.

Result: 现有全参考质量度量在这些失真上表现不佳（最大Pearson相关性0.78），CGVQM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGVQM在合成内容质量评估中表现优异，数据集和度量方法已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Method: 提出TeleEval-OS基准，涵盖四个运营阶段和四个能力层级，采用零样本和少样本评估方法。

Result: 开源LLMs在特定场景下表现优于闭源LLMs，展示了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS为LLMs在电信运营调度中的应用提供了系统评估工具，开源模型在某些场景中具有显著价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

Result: 实验显示多模态交互加剧位置偏差，且偏差随检索范围对数增长。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG系统的位置感知分析提供了理论和实证基础，建议采用证据重排序或去偏策略以提高系统可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between

this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language

dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:

Conclusion: 模态表达会显著影响LLMs的义务判断，需通过技术手段缓解此类偏差以确保判断对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

Result: 机器评估和跨领域人类研究表明，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现对原型模型的精准控制。

Conclusion: 该接口架构有效弥补了设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，提升了原型模型控制的精确性和效率。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言查询中易产生对象幻觉，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Result: 在POPE和MME基准测试中，CLAIM平均提升了13.56%和21.75%的性能。

Conclusion: 多语言注意力差异在中间层最为显著，CLAIM为多语言场景提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了CyclicReflex的有效性，优于标准解码和其他方法。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex是一种有效的解码策略，能够提升LRMs的性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过经验学习和逻辑推理解决了假新闻检测中的关键挑战，提供了一种无需训练即可适应动态环境的方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across

### [105] [MANBench: Is Your Multimodal Model Smarter than Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11080)
*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench是一个双语基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中的表现，发现其在某些领域仍不及人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLMs是否能在多模态任务中超越人类表现，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 开发MANBench基准测试，包含1,314个问题，覆盖九项任务，并进行人类与MLLMs的对比实验。

Result: MLLMs在知识和文本-图像理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理任务中表现不佳，且复杂任务对两者均具挑战性。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，呼吁进一步研究以缩小其与人类多模态能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

### [106] [SAGE:Specification-Aware Grammar Extraction for Automated Test Case Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11081)
*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用开源大语言模型（LLM）从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFG）的方法，结合少量标注示例和奖励引导的强化学习，显著提升了文法质量和测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范中生成有效且通用的文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。CCFGs被提出作为表示此类规范的形式化方法，但如何高效生成仍待解决。

Method: 方法包括微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的翻译，并应用组相对策略优化（GRPO）提升文法的有效性和通用性。还研究了迭代反馈对修正文法错误的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE方法在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM，文法有效性提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了从自然语言规范生成文法的能力，为有限监督下的文法生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

### [107] [PRISM: A Transformer-based Language Model of Structured Clinical Event Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11082)
*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策过程的序列进展，通过学习预测患者诊断旅程中的下一步，显著优于随机基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，而PRISM旨在捕捉临床轨迹中的复杂依赖关系，为临床决策支持、模拟和教育提供新方法。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列（如诊断测试、实验室结果和诊断），并利用自回归训练目标和大规模临床词汇表进行建模。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在下一标记预测任务中显著优于随机基线，生成的序列反映了现实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于序列的医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型技术在结构化医疗数据中的可行性。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

### [108] [RedDebate: Safer Responses through Multi-Agent Red Teaming Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11083)
*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate是一种多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证自动识别和减少不安全行为，无需依赖人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险问题。

Method: 利用多LLM协作辩论和红队测试，结合长期记忆模块迭代改进安全性。

Result: 辩论可减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块可减少23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个结合多智能体辩论和红队测试的全自动化AI安全框架。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPACE框架通过编辑共享激活子空间，同时提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性，解决了现有方法独立处理幻觉类型导致的性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实际部署中因事实性和忠实性幻觉问题受限，现有方法独立处理这些问题时导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过激活空间动态分析，发现幻觉类型共享子空间，提出SPACE框架，结合双任务特征建模和混合探针策略（谱聚类与注意力头显著性评分）编辑共享子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明SPACE框架的优越性。

Conclusion: SPACE为LLMs的幻觉问题提供了统一的解决方案，通过共享子空间编辑实现了事实性和忠实性的同步提升。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

### [110] [Customizing Speech Recognition Model with Large Language Model Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11091)
*Shaoshi Ling,Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用未标注数据和LLM反馈提升ASR系统在命名实体识别上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR系统在通用转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍存在困难。LLM因其大规模训练数据在多领域表现更优。

Method: 通过强化学习方法，利用LLM作为奖励模型对ASR模型的假设进行评分，并将评分作为奖励信号微调ASR模型。

Result: 相比传统自训练方法，命名实体的词错误率提升了21%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的领域适应能力，显著提升了ASR系统在命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT)，一种轻量级框架，扩展了RAG以支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统局限于静态、单轮交互，无法适应动态领域（如医疗和智能家居）的需求。

Method: DCT结合了注意力机制上下文缓存、LoRA检索和高效上下文压缩，动态选择工具并跟踪历史信息。

Result: 实验表明，DCT将计划准确性提高14%，幻觉减少37%，并以更低成本匹配GPT-4性能。

Conclusion: DCT能泛化到未见过的工具，适用于广泛的动态环境，实现可扩展和适应性强的AI助手。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信息差理论的框架，通过量化文本语义结构中的信息差来建模读者好奇心，并结合BERTopic和持久同调方法分析动态语义网络的拓扑特征。实验验证了该方法在预测读者好奇心方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与度至关重要，但在NLP领域尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过信息差理论建模好奇心。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模和持久同调技术，分析文本动态语义网络的拓扑特征（如连通性、循环、空洞），作为信息差的代理指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了好奇心预测的准确性（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度的关系提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了C-SEO Bench，首个评估C-SEO方法在多任务、多领域和多参与者场景下的基准，发现当前方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究C-SEO方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖多种任务、领域和参与者数量，提出新的评估协议。

Result: 当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；参与者增多时整体收益下降。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有零和性质，传统SEO策略在多参与者场景中表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ManyICL方法，通过多样本上下文微调缩小与专用微调的性能差距，并减少灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习方法（如few-shot ICL）性能仍落后于专用微调，且存在效率低和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出ManyICL，扩展ICL到多样本设置，并设计新训练目标，将上下文中的每个答案作为监督目标。

Result: ManyICL在多种任务上显著优于零/少样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: ManyICL是一种高效且性能接近专用微调的方法，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决长序列任务中注意力效率低下的问题，无需预定义掩码结构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏注意力方法使用静态预定义掩码，无法捕捉异构注意力模式，导致长序列任务中的性能下降。

Method: DAM在注意力图级别动态分配自适应掩码，保留各层和头的异构模式，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型性能接近，显著减少内存和计算开销，适用于大规模语言模型。

Conclusion: DAM为长序列任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，无需牺牲检索性能。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Conclusion: 该压缩框架为LLMs在资源受限环境中的部署提供了可行方案，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，证明了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过结构化推理和依赖感知机制，显著提升了RAG方法的性能。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured

across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC扩展了CAGSR框架，利用vLLM运行时处理多轮对话和思维链推理，通过异步捕获注意力权重和自监督奖励函数优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话和思维链推理中的注意力机制优化问题，提升模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 在vLLM运行时中实现异步捕获注意力权重，并扩展自监督奖励函数以累积对话历史和思维链步骤的注意力信号。

Result: 提出了基于熵的注意力权重限制机制，防止早期上下文注意力崩溃，并展示了在多轮对话和思维链推理中的潜力。

Conclusion: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC为多轮对话和思维链推理提供了有效解决方案，未来可扩展至多方对话和分层推理。

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob是一个新颖的框架，通过改进位置标记化和多目标微调，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）在移动数据分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在位置语义表示和移动信号建模方面存在不足，限制了LLMs在移动数据分析中的应用。

Method: QT-Mob提出了一种位置标记化模块和互补的微调目标，以增强LLMs对移动数据的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLMs对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench评估大型语言模型（LLM）在面对用户对立陈述时保持事实一致性的能力，通过构建两种对立提示来测试模型的同意和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在用户对立陈述下是否坚持事实一致性，而非随用户观点变化。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中采样事实，构建两种对立提示（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意和推理。

Result: 通过分层结果，隔离框架诱导的变异性，衡量模型在事实一致性上的表现。

Conclusion: AssertBench旨在量化LLM在面对对立用户断言时坚持事实的能力。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Motivation: 同行评审对学术质量至关重要，但日益增长的投稿量给评审者带来负担。LLMs可能提供帮助，但其易受对抗攻击的特性引发了可靠性担忧。

Method: 研究聚焦三个问题：LLMs生成评审的效果、对抗攻击对LLM评审的影响，以及缓解策略。通过实验评估LLMs在对抗攻击下的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，文本操纵会扭曲其评审结果。

Conclusion: 论文强调需解决对抗风险，以确保AI增强而非损害学术交流的完整性。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多为文本、英语为主且集中于医学领域，无法全面评估多模态和多语言医疗知识。

Method: 构建包含11588道真实考题的多模态基准测试，涵盖医学、牙科、护理等多个领域，并评估30多种先进LLMs。

Result: 尽管部分模型表现良好，但无模型在所有领域均达到通过标准。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为多语言和多模态医疗AI的评估与发展提供了全面资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记化方法在材料科学中导致过度碎片化和语义损失，无法保持材料概念的结构和语义完整性。

Method: 提出MATTER方法，结合材料知识库训练的MatDetector和重新排序方法，优先合并材料概念。

Result: MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别平均提升4%和2%的性能。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理中的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct是一个高质量指令数据集，通过两阶段流程提升LLM的基础和聊天能力，显著超越现有开源模型，甚至在某些任务上优于GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集局限于狭窄领域，限制了LLM的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 从1亿样本中筛选740万高质量基础指令；2) 通过选择、进化和诊断过滤合成150万高质量聊天指令。

Result: 微调多个开源模型后，在基础和指令跟随任务上表现显著提升，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上优于GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM全面发展提供了新思路，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和QA数据集过于简单，无法满足真实研究需求，需开发更贴近实际信息需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集信息提取方法、认知分类的问题生成框架，以及基于LLM困惑度变化的答案过滤方法。

Result: 生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在复杂问题推理上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了支持科学复杂信息需求的工具发展。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Motivation: 早期检测ADRD对干预和治疗至关重要，语音和语言特征可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，筛选703例健康对照、81例轻度认知障碍和405例AD病例，评估多种开源语音和语言模型的分类性能。

Result: Whisper-medium语音模型表现最佳（准确率0.731，AUC 0.802），BERT语言模型次之（准确率0.662，AUC 0.744）。ASR生成的音频嵌入效果优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于声学特征的方法（尤其是ASR嵌入）在ADRD早期检测中具有可扩展、非侵入和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）性能强大，但其部署成本高昂。梯度剪枝方法虽有效，但忽略了生成能力的关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，专注于MLP模块的剪枝，以更准确地利用原始模型的预测信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，并在1B规模的开源LLM中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自蒸馏损失和MLP模块剪枝，实现了高效压缩且性能无明显下降。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

Motivation: 现实领域不匹配导致ASR性能下降，TTA与语言模型结合时存在干扰问题，需解决。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，基于熵最小化的TTA方法，结合语言模型重评分，通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程。

Result: 在18个ASR数据集上实验，SUTA-LM表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM有效结合TTA与语言模型，提升ASR跨领域性能。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术，具有高度可扩展性和欺骗性，亟需有效防御手段。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动，并设计EchoGuard利用自然失真（如回声）干扰ASR。通过39人用户研究评估效果。

Result: EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类听觉体验上表现最佳，综合效用最高。

Conclusion: EchoGuard是一种实用且高效的防御方案，能有效破坏语音钓鱼攻击的反馈循环。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型能力的提升，其错误模式越来越接近人类的推理谬误，而非逻辑正确性的提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着能力的提升而趋近于人类的推理模式，尤其是错误模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具，评估38个语言模型在383个推理任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，其错误答案中与人类推理谬误一致的比例显著增加（ρ = 0.360, p = 0.0265）。

Conclusion: 语言模型的错误模式趋近于人类认知，包括其偏见和局限性，挑战了模型规模扩大必然带来规范性理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Conclusion: CHECK为医疗等高风险领域提供了可扩展的安全LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升问题，避免依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 利用现有ASR生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，合成语音文本对并反馈至ASR模型。

Result: Twister模型在普通话和汉英混合任务中分别降低20%和50%错误率。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源ASR提供高效改进路径，优于传统伪标签自蒸馏方法。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从EHR的非结构化笔记中提取药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工标注，难以扩展。

Method: 收集三个EHR数据集，评估12种LLMs，比较药物提取、状态分类及联合任务的性能，并探索多种提示策略。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本设置下表现最佳（提取F1 94.0%，分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%），开源模型紧随其后。医学专用LLMs表现不如通用LLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物提取和停用分类中潜力巨大，开源模型可替代专有系统，少量样本学习能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Motivation: 代表全球南方研究机构在计算资源受限条件下的实际需求，证明小模型在低预算硬件上的可行性。

Method: 使用参数少于1B的小模型参与共享任务，并在低预算GPU或无GPU环境下运行。

Result: 在五个赛道中，与优胜者的性能差距分别为6.46、10.24、7.85、9.56和13.13（exact F1分数）。

Conclusion: 小模型（<1B参数）在低预算硬件上仍具有竞争力，适合资源受限的研究环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a

Result: 在八种语言和五个人口统计维度上验证，IMSAE在标准及零样本设置中优于传统单语言和跨语言方法，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: IMSAE有效利用多语言表示共享语义空间的优势，显著提升去偏效果，适用于多种语言模型。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: SEAR框架通过自适应提示和结构化推理显著提升了时间表推理任务的性能，为LLMs的表推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否可以通过学习专用标记（如“<|continue-thinking|>”）来触发扩展推理，以提升语言模型的性能。

Method: 方法是通过强化学习训练一个专用标记的嵌入，同时冻结模型权重，将其应用于蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，学习标记方法在数学基准测试（如GSM8K）上比固定标记方法（如“Wait”）和基线模型表现更好，准确性提升显著（4.2% vs 1.3%）。

Conclusion: 结论是学习专用“继续思考”标记是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，能显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，并提供了可扩展、数据高效模型开发的实用建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在固定上下文窗口和二次复杂度的问题，而RNN架构虽能线性扩展但并行性受限。Avey旨在解决这些问题。

Result: Avey在短程NLP任务中表现与Transformer相当，在长程依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey提供了一种高效处理长序列的新方法，兼具Transformer和RNN的优点。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Result: 模型困惑度与预测能力呈正相关，表明这一趋势不仅适用于阅读时间，还可推广到神经测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理的预测能力具有普遍相关性。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于变分信息瓶颈（VIB）框架的新方法，用于减少关系抽取（RE）中的实体偏差，提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系抽取模型过度依赖实体信息，导致泛化能力差，需要一种方法来压缩实体信息同时保留任务相关特征。

Method: 采用变分信息瓶颈（VIB）框架，压缩实体特定信息，保留任务相关特征。

Result: 在通用、金融和生物医学领域的关系抽取数据集上，无论是域内（原始测试集）还是域外（修改后的测试集）均取得最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种鲁棒、可解释且理论扎实的解决方案，有效缓解了实体偏差问题。

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and
theoretically grounded methodology.

*Karanpartap Singh,Neil Band,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS框架通过逐步增加模型深度与数据难度同步，提升预训练效率，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知发展启发，希望通过逐步增加模型深度与数据难度同步，提高预训练效率。

Method: 提出CGLS框架，通过逐步堆叠层（逐渐增加层数）与数据难度同步，使用不同难度的数据（从简单到复杂）进行训练。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优于基线方法，提升了泛化能力和零样本性能。

Conclusion: CGLS通过渐进式堆叠层与数据难度同步，是一种简单有效的策略，显著提升了知识密集型和推理任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age

applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey

that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%
specificity.

TL;DR: Chelsea是一种在线KV缓存聚类框架，通过分块软匹配策略减少KV缓存内存使用，同时保持模型性能，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM的KV缓存需求大，现有方法要么丢弃关键信息，要么效率提升有限，亟需一种高效解决方案。

Method: 将序列分块，采用交替分区策略和相似性聚类，合并KV缓存为单一质心，并进行理论分析。

Result: 实验显示，Chelsea减少80% KV缓存内存使用，解码速度提升3.19倍，端到端延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea是一种简单有效的KV缓存优化框架，显著提升长上下文LLM的部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR通过引入代理指导机制，提升了RLVR在复杂代理环境中的效果，显著提高了模型在软件工程任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中效果不佳，因奖励稀疏导致训练困难。

Method: 提出Agent-RLVR框架，结合代理指导机制，通过多样化信息线索引导代理完成任务。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified任务中，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂现实环境中RLVR的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

TL;DR: KoGEC是一个基于预训练翻译模型的韩语语法纠错系统，通过微调NLLB模型，在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的韩语语法纠错系统，并探索任务专用模型在专业NLP任务中的潜力。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU分数和LLM评估方法进行测试。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在标点错误纠正上更平衡。

Conclusion: KoGEC展示了任务专用模型在专业NLP任务中的竞争力，并提供了新的评估方法。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AbsenceBench，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）检测缺失信息的能力，发现即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在5K上下文中F1分数仅为69.6%，揭示了Transformer注意力机制在检测“空白”时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在长文本中定位特定信息表现出色（如NIAH测试），但在检测明显缺失信息时表现不佳，因此需要评估其在这一任务上的能力。

Method: 提出AbsenceBench，通过三个领域（数字序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）测试模型识别被删除信息的能力，对比原始和编辑后的文本。

Result: 实验显示，即使先进模型在5K上下文中F1分数仅为69.6%，表明模型在检测缺失信息时存在困难。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理“空白”信息，导致模型在检测缺失信息时表现不佳，突显了其在某些任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的机器翻译系统缺乏有效的自动评估指标和足够的人类评估者，需要一种新的解决方案来填补这一资源缺口。

Method: 论文首先综述了现有评估方法，然后设计了一个招募和游戏化评估平台，以解决数据集和评估者短缺的问题。

Result: 提出了一个针对机器翻译系统开发者的招募和游戏化评估平台设计，并讨论了其评估挑战和潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该平台设计为低资源语言机器翻译系统的开发提供了新的评估资源，并可能在更广泛的自然语言处理研究中发挥作用。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床决策中存在推理步骤错误定位和修正的不足，这对医学诊断至关重要。

Method: Med-PRM通过检索医学知识库验证每个推理步骤，结合检索增强生成技术。

Result: 在五个医学QA基准和两个开放式诊断任务中，Med-PRM性能提升达13.50%，并在小规模模型上首次实现MedQA超过80%的准确率。

Conclusion: Med-PRM在临床决策中表现出色，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past

Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural

grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了BERT是否真正理解抽象关系，发现预训练BERT虽能高精度分类关系，但关系模式需通过微调任务才能显现在嵌入空间中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BERT是否具备抽象关系理解能力，而非仅依赖表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT内部表示，比较预训练和微调后对分类任务的表现。

Result: 预训练BERT能高精度分类关系，但关系模式需微调后才在嵌入空间中显现。

Conclusion: 行为表现不必然反映结构化概念理解，但模型可通过训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏置。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA)的方法，通过LagKV压缩技术减少长上下文处理的计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文输入时面临计算复杂度和内存占用高的挑战，现有压缩技术常导致性能下降。

Method: 采用LagKV压缩方法，通过分块预填充选择最相关的键值对，结合LRSA稀疏注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答任务中取得更好的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法在减少计算和内存开销的同时，有效提升了模型处理长上下文的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Result: 实验结果表明，端到端方法性能与两步法相当，且参数共享策略在减少参数的同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在多模态对话响应生成中具有潜力，参数共享策略能有效提升模型效率。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Conclusion: MUDI通过图学习和一致性注意力，有效提升个性化对话生成的自然性和连贯性。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

Motivation: 探讨场景上下文如何影响人类对同一抽象形状的不同概念化和命名方式。

Method: 提出SceneGram数据集，收集人类在不同场景下对抽象形状的命名，并分析多模态LLM的表现。

Result: 多模态LLM未能复现人类概念化的多样性和丰富性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文对人类概念化有显著影响，而现有多模态LLM在此方面存在不足。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在领域特定任务（尤其是小型边缘侧模型）上的效果和效率仍有局限。

Method: 利用云端大模型生成LoRA参数，通过重参数化技术合并到边缘侧模型，减少输入上下文长度。

Result: 在推理任务中，LoRA-Gen优于传统LoRA微调，实现2.1倍加速；在智能代理任务中，压缩比达10.1倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen无需专门训练，即可高效实现知识迁移和模型专业化。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

### [167] [Converting Annotated Clinical Cases into Structured Case Report Forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11666)
*Pietro Ferrazzi,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动方法，将现有信息抽取数据集转换为结构化CRF数据集，以解决CRF数据稀缺问题，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了CRF槽填充系统的开发。

Method: 提出半自动转换方法，将E3C数据集转换为结构化CRF数据集（英语和意大利语）。

Result: 实验显示，槽填充任务在零-shot LLMs上表现一般（意大利语59.7%，英语67.3%），开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 填充CRF对当前LLMs仍具挑战性，新数据集已公开。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing用于分析模型行为中特定语言信息的影响，通过移除目标信息并观察性能变化。INLP方法存在随机修改问题，而MP和LEACE能更精准地移除信息，提升行为解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除模型中的特定信息，以准确评估其对任务性能的影响。

Method: 提出Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE两种方法，与INLP对比，测试其在Amnesic probing中的效果。

Result: MP和LEACE能更精准地移除目标信息，减少对模型其他信息的干扰，优于INLP。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE改进了Amnesic probing的信息移除技术，为模型行为解释提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into
sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and
logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid
approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to

### [170] [Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11702)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT)的新框架，用于动态调整语言模型行为，突破了传统静态偏好模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类反馈模型（如DPO）假设偏好是单一且静态的，限制了模型的适应性。CPT旨在通过可解释的指令实现动态行为调整。

Method: CPT利用基于结构化细粒度规则生成的合成偏好数据，通过系统提示指导模型在推理时动态调整输出，无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，CPT能够实现细粒度控制，并建模更复杂、上下文相关的人类反馈。相关代码、数据集和模型已开源。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型提供了动态适应性和更精细的控制能力，为AI对齐领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

*Héctor Martínez,Adrián Castelló,Francisco D. Igual,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统64位浮点计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16和8/16位整数）的趋势，并提出了适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的高性能矩阵乘法（gemm）优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DL对计算效率的需求增加，低精度和混合精度计算成为趋势，但传统gemm优化方法已不适用于现代硬件架构。

Method: 论文提出了新的微内核设计和数据布局，以更好地利用现代ISA（如x86_64、ARM和RISC-V）的混合精度点积操作。

Result: 实验表明，MIP算术在三种代表性CPU架构上相比浮点实现具有显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 这些贡献标志着矩阵乘法优化的新时代，即由DL推理需求驱动的“寒武纪时期”。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理在LLMs中计算开销大，限制了其在延迟敏感应用中的部署。

Method: DART通过两条训练路径（CoT路径和ST路径）和一个轻量级的Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）实现推理效率提升。

Result: 实验表明，DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: DART是高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

*Mingxuan Du,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepResearch Bench是一个用于评估深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准，包含100个PhD级别的研究任务，并提出两种评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统性评估DRA能力的基准，因此开发了DeepResearch Bench。

Method: 提出了两种评估方法：基于参考的自适应标准评估报告质量，以及评估信息检索和引用能力的框架。

Result: 开源了DeepResearch Bench和关键评估框架组件。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法有助于加速实用LLM代理的开发。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角，关注模型输出分布的长短对齐问题，并提出了一种正则化方法以提升长上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文建模中受限于固定的上下文窗口，长度泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过案例研究提出长短对齐概念，设计Long-Short Misalignment指标，并开发正则化方法。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，长短对齐与长度泛化性能强相关。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLMs的长上下文建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at
https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongShortAlignment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过零样本角色提示可以预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为，准确率较高（F1分数约0.793）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中表现出进步左倾偏见，研究探讨是否能用角色提示预测个体投票行为及群体政策立场。

Method: 使用零样本角色提示和有限信息，分析其对欧洲议会投票行为的预测能力，并评估其对反事实论点、不同提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，角色提示能较好地模拟欧洲议会议员的投票行为，F1分数约为0.793。

Conclusion: 角色提示可用于预测政治行为，提供了一种模拟群体政策立场的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但它是评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）语用能力的有效探针。

Method: 通过分析模型在颜色描述上下文依赖解释任务中的表现。

Result: 结果表明，即使是先进的多模态大语言模型，在基本语用能力（如颜色描述的上下文理解）上仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在基本语用能力方面仍需改进。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多轮对话中难以保持人物一致性和生成个性化响应的问题。

Method: PPA首先生成通用响应，再检索相关人物记忆并优化响应以对齐人物特征。

Result: 实验表明PPA在一致性、多样性和人物相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时，KV缓存的内存需求增加，现有压缩方法要么牺牲准确性，要么引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，通过傅里叶基投影压缩长上下文不敏感的维度，并设计FlashFourierAttention优化内存。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务中实现了最佳的长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: FourierAttention是一种无需训练的框架，能高效压缩KV缓存，同时保持性能，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Motivation: 评估反仇恨言论（CS）的有效性标准尚未明确，需要一种系统化的方法来分类和分析其效果。

Method: 提出一个计算框架，定义六个核心维度（清晰度、证据、情感诉求、反驳、受众适应性和公平性），并标注大量CS实例。采用多任务和依赖关系两种分类策略。

Result: 两种分类策略在专家和用户撰写的CS上表现优异（平均F1分别为0.94和0.96），优于基线方法，并揭示了维度间的强相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为CS有效性评估提供了新工具，揭示了维度间的依赖关系，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在外部反馈下能改进回答，但存在反馈阻力（FEEDBACK FRICTION），即使理想条件下模型仍难以完全整合反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在理想反馈条件下是否能完全整合外部反馈并修正错误。

Method: 设计实验环境，模型尝试解答后接收接近完美的反馈并再次尝试，评估多任务表现。

Result: 模型表现出反馈阻力，改进策略效果有限，未达目标性能。

Conclusion: 反馈阻力是LLMs的普遍问题，需进一步研究以提升自我改进能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以泛化，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用对比表示学习（CRL）框架，结合三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘，优化模型表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有防御方法，提升了对抗输入和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，且不影响标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的CRL框架为LLMs防御提供了有效且泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage

*Yuliang Xu,Siming Huang,Mingmeng Geng,Yao Wan,Xuanhua Shi,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对代码风格的影响，通过分析GitHub代码库发现LLMs改变了命名规范、复杂性和可维护性等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，代码生成能力开始显著改变编程实践，研究旨在量化LLMs对代码风格的影响。

Method: 分析了2020至2025年间与arXiv论文相关的19,000多个GitHub代码库，研究命名规范、复杂性和相似性等指标。

Result: 发现LLMs生成的代码风格特征明显，例如Python中snake_case变量名比例从2023年的47%增至2025年的51%。

Conclusion: LLMs确实影响了现实世界的编程风格，但难以精确量化其贡献比例。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

### [184] [Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796)
*Elias Najarro,Nicolas Bessone,Sebastian Risi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的逆向建模方法，用于处理可观测空间中的随机性，通过视觉嵌入捕捉感知不变性，从而恢复未知因果参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自组织系统中，从宏观观测中推断未知因果参数是一个基本挑战，尤其在观测具有强随机性时，传统方法难以捕捉特征相似性。

Method: 利用视觉嵌入生成鲁棒表示，将模式映射到不变嵌入空间，无需手工设计目标函数或启发式方法。

Result: 在反应扩散系统和社会隔离的基于代理模型中，该方法能可靠地恢复参数，并成功应用于真实生物模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论和实验研究复杂随机模式形成的动态提供了潜在工具。

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Conclusion: 预训练在学习和泛化丰富且不变的语音表示中至关重要。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

Conclusion: GLAP在多语言和跨领域音频理解中具有显著优势，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于计算模拟的语音测试方法（SimPhon Speech Test），用于更精准地诊断老年性耳聋中的超阈值听力缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性耳聋中超阈值听力缺陷的诊断不足，需要开发更具体的语音感知测试方法。

Method: 利用自动语音识别（ASR）系统模拟听力损失，通过多阶段计算流程设计和验证语音测试集（SimPhon Speech Test-25）。

Result: 测试集的表现与标准语音可懂度指数（SII）无显著相关性，表明其能捕捉超出简单可听性的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: SimPhon Speech Test-25为听力测试开发提供了高效的计算优化方法，准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的高度量子化模糊神经网络（HQFNN），将模糊推理与量子计算结合，实现了高效、鲁棒的图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习视觉系统在噪声输入或需要解释置信度时表现不佳，模糊推理和量子计算分别提供了透明性和参数效率，结合二者可改进性能。

Method: HQFNN通过量子电路实现模糊推理流程，将图像特征映射到量子比特状态，通过紧凑规则层和CNOT去模糊器生成分类结果。

Result: HQFNN在标准图像基准测试中优于经典、模糊增强和纯量子基线，且参数更少，噪声下表现稳健。

Conclusion: HQFNN是一种紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的视觉模型，为未来量子模糊学习框架提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VeTTA的新框架，用于学习树状几何数据的向量表示，专注于3D血管网络。通过两个Transformer自编码器分阶段训练，实现了高效且精确的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D卷积模型在GPU内存需求上较高，难以支持大规模训练，因此需要一种更高效的方法来建模树状结构数据。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer自编码器：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码血管网络的拓扑结构。

Result: 在2D合成树数据集和3D冠状动脉数据集上表现出优异的重建保真度、拓扑保持能力和潜在空间插值效果。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架提供了一种高效、精确且拓扑一致的树状结构建模方法，适用于医学影像领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

Motivation: 探索INRs的基本能力、隐式偏差和扩展行为，以填补当前对其理解的空白。

Method: 通过分析多种INRs在2D和3D信号上的表现，包括过拟合和泛化任务（如断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪），并根据模型大小、信号类型和带宽分层性能。

Result: 大多数任务中，正则化网格比相同参数量的INRs训练更快且质量更高；INRs仅在拟合低维结构信号时表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs在特定任务（如低维结构信号）中具有优势，未来应将其应用于这些场景。代码和信号数据已开源。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

Motivation: 现有AD诊断方法多依赖单模态数据，而医学专家通常采用多模态方法，需要一种能处理多模态或缺失输入的系统。

Method: ADAgent结合推理引擎、专业医疗工具和协作结果协调器，支持多模态诊断和预后任务。

Conclusion: ADAgent为AD分析提供了首个专用AI代理，能够高效处理多模态数据和用户查询，支持决策制定。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: DiffPR通过取消高频跳跃连接和引入扩散模型，解决了QPI中的过平滑问题，显著提升了图像质量和细节恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中U-Net的低频偏好导致QPI图像细节丢失，高频跳跃连接加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出DiffPR框架：第一阶段用无高频跳跃的U-Net预测低频相位图；第二阶段用扩散模型恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个数据集上，DiffPR的PSNR提升1.1 dB，MAE降低11%，细节恢复更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并结合扩散模型是解决频谱偏置的有效方法。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜投影图像）中表现有限，但传统分类平均方法利用数据冗余性有效去噪。本文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 设计了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，同时完成图像聚类、对齐和去噪任务。

Result: 在合成数据上，该架构将单图像DNN的相对均方误差降低了45%（信噪比为0.03时）。

Conclusion: 该架构在高噪声环境下表现出色，为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Conclusion: FAD-Net在CAD的精确诊断和治疗规划中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

Motivation: 高分辨率CT成像对医学诊断至关重要，但辐射剂量与图像质量之间存在矛盾。现有深度学习方法在复杂退化和有限医学数据上面临挑战。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion，通过实际退化模型合成低质量图像，并使用预训练视觉语言模型生成描述，结合低分辨率输入和文本描述进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够在降低辐射剂量的同时实现高质量CT成像。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学成像中结合预训练扩散模型的潜力，为高质量低剂量CT成像提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有压缩视频超分辨率模型存在推理时间长、训练流程复杂等问题，且传统方法难以满足高帧率视频的需求。

Method: 采用压缩驱动的降维策略，设计模块化架构以降低计算复杂度并提升时间信息提取能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能达到或超越当前SOTA模型，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频超分辨率技术提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑网络基础模型研究有限且局限于单一维度，限制了其在神经科学中的广泛应用。

Method: 模型包含两个模块：(1)适配器模块扩展脑区特征维度；(2)基于自监督学习的预训练脑网络模型，利用Transformer块提取特征和计算区域关联。

Result: 模型在脑疾病诊断中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该模型为脑网络分析研究提供了有前景的新方法。

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

*Zuzanna Skorniewska,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在医学影像中使用深度生成模型生成合成数据的优势，重点研究了基于距离的损失函数与传统方法的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据受隐私法规、数据稀缺和人口偏差限制，深度生成模型可生成合成数据以解决这些问题。

Method: 研究比较了基于距离的损失函数与感知损失和边缘检测损失函数的效果。

Result: 研究发现，领域特定的深度特征并未提升图像生成质量，而传统边缘检测滤波器能显著改善血管结构的清晰度。

Conclusion: 传统边缘检测方法在医学影像合成中表现更优，领域特定特征未带来明显改进。

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MS-DT的新型框架，通过整合多尺度生物力学数据和计算建模，为肌肉骨骼系统创建详细的个性化数字孪生模型，用于精准诊断和治疗规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌肉骨骼疾病（MSDs）是全球致残的主要原因，需要先进的诊断和治疗工具。数字孪生（DT）范式因其能整合异构数据源而成为有效管理MSDs的有价值选择。

Method: MS-DT框架结合了运动捕捉、超声成像、肌电图和医学影像，通过计算建模生成患者特定的肌肉骨骼系统模型，并提供交互式可视化平台。

Conclusion: MS-DT框架通过高保真建模和实时可视化，提升了患者特异性诊断和干预规划的能力。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and
intervention planning.

*Zhangkai Ni,Yang Zhang,Wenhan Yang,Hanli Wang,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构相似性展开（SSIU）的高效图像超分辨率方法，结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，通过混合尺度门控模块和稀疏注意力模块实现高性能且紧凑的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的超分辨率方法通常通过增加模型深度或使用注意力机制来扩大感受野，但会导致模型复杂度增加。模型驱动的方法通过展开范式在保持紧凑性的同时提升性能，因此希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出SSIU方法，通过展开受结构相似性约束的优化函数设计模型。每轮迭代包含混合尺度门控模块（MSGM）和高效稀疏注意力模块（ESAM），并设计了基于专家混合的特征选择器（MoE-FS）以充分利用多级特征信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上优于当前最先进模型，同时参数数量和内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU方法通过结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

TL;DR: MindGrab是一种高效、参数和内存优化的深度学习模型，用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离，性能优于传统方法，且资源需求显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效且适用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离工具，以解决现有方法在资源需求和性能上的不足。

Method: 基于频谱解释的膨胀卷积架构，仅使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: MindGrab在多模态数据集上平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当但参数减少95%，推理速度更快且内存占用更低。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli
(https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

TL;DR: 跨模态域适应挑战（crossMoDA）专注于无监督跨模态分割，从ceT1 MRI迁移到T2 MRI，旨在自动化VS和耳蜗分割。挑战逐年演进，数据多样性和任务复杂性增加，2023年获胜方法在异构数据上表现提升，但耳蜗分割性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该挑战旨在解决临床中T2 MRI上VS和耳蜗分割的自动化需求，以降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 挑战逐年演进，从单机构数据到多机构数据，再到异构数据，任务从基础分割扩展到肿瘤子分割和Koos分级。

Result: 2023年获胜方法在异构数据上表现提升，但耳蜗分割性能下降。数据多样性减少异常值，但复杂性增加可能影响整体性能。

Conclusion: 尽管VS分割仍需改进，但性能趋于平稳，未来可能需要更具挑战性的跨模态任务作为基准。

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

Result: 提供了对KGR研究更全面的视角，总结了关键研究趋势和未来方向。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了现有研究的空白，为KGR领域的未来发展提供了指导。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

Motivation: 临床沟通技能在医学教育中至关重要，但大规模练习和评估这些技能具有挑战性。现有LLM驱动的临床场景模拟虽有效，但难以提供符合医生主观判断的自动化评估。

Method: 通过数据收集、基于多维模糊集的数据标注、提示工程和基于人类标注的监督微调（SFT），开发LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法。

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge在评估中达到80%以上的准确率，主要标准项超过90%，实现了可解释且符合人类偏好的评估。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑与LLM的结合可行，推动了医学教育中自动化评估的发展，支持更稳健的评估实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

TL;DR: ChemTable是一个针对化学表格的多模态基准测试，旨在提升科学理解能力，但现有模型在描述性和推理性任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了化学表格的多模态和领域复杂性，限制了多模态大语言模型在化学科学理解中的应用。

Method: 引入ChemTable，一个从文献实验部分提取的大规模化学表格基准，包含专家标注的单元格、逻辑布局和领域标签，支持表格识别和理解任务。

Result: 模型在基本布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性问答任务上显著落后于人类表现，开源与闭源模型间存在明显差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为科学推理提供了一个严格且现实的基准，突显了化学感知表格理解的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG范式忽略了知识应用的认知步骤，导致检索事实与任务推理之间存在鸿沟。

Method: RAG+构建了一个包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域的实验中，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景下峰值提升达7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过结合检索与可操作应用，为知识整合提供了更认知基础的框架，推动了更可解释和强大的语言模型发展。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs在房地产评估中具有潜力，需优化提示策略以提升性能，为利益相关者提供实用指导。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中的应用增加，其潜在的伦理问题（如人口统计偏差、问责制和隐私）日益凸显。本文旨在分析这些系统如何学习数据中的偏差，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过一个基于AI的自动化招聘案例研究，提出了一种隐私增强框架，以减少学习流程中的性别信息。实验分析了数据偏差对两种不同LLMs构建的系统的影响。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的框架有效防止了训练系统复制数据中的偏差。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架能够显著减少基于Transformer的系统在自动化招聘中的性别偏见，为高风险的LLMs应用提供了伦理改进的方向。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

*Claudio Fanconi,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种级联LLM决策框架，通过自适应任务委派平衡预测正确性、成本与置信度，结合在线学习机制提升决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作决策中预测正确性、成本与置信度的平衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：延迟策略决定是否接受基础模型答案或调用更大模型；弃权策略决定是否需要人工干预。结合在线学习机制。

Result: 在通用问答和医学问答任务中，级联策略在多数情况下优于单模型基线，同时降低成本并处理弃权情况。

Conclusion: 级联框架有效平衡了人机协作决策的关键因素，提升了准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的Schema-R1模型，用于提升Text-to-SQL任务中模式链接的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式链接模型过度依赖死记硬背的学习方式，缺乏推理能力，且高质量推理样本难以获取。

Method: Schema-R1通过构建高质量推理样本、监督微调初始化和基于规则的强化学习训练三个步骤实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在过滤准确率上比现有方法提升了10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1有效提升了模式链接模型的推理能力，为Text-to-SQL任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

*Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinwen Hou,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双域扩散模型水印方法（GaussMarker），通过在空间和频率域嵌入水印，并结合可学习的高斯噪声恢复器（GNR），显著提升了水印的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成图像的真实性提升，版权和滥用问题日益突出。现有水印方法在单域嵌入水印时鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双域水印嵌入方法（空间域和频率域），并引入模型无关的可学习GNR以增强对图像操作和高级攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 在八种图像失真和四种高级攻击下，GaussMarker在三个Stable Diffusion版本中表现出最佳性能，召回率更高且误报率更低。

Conclusion: GaussMarker为扩散模型水印提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

TL;DR: SAE-BrainMap用稀疏自编码器（SAE）将深度学习视觉模型与fMRI信号对齐，构建了模型层与人脑视觉通路的精细映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立深度学习模型与人脑视觉皮层之间的直接联系，以增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 训练层间SAE，计算SAE单元与fMRI信号的余弦相似度，构建体素字典，并映射模型层与视觉通路。

Result: SAE单元与fMRI信号相关性高（最大相似度0.76），ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$在早期层利用低层信息生成高层语义。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人脑视觉皮层提供了无下游任务的直接桥梁，提升了模型可解释性。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大脑动态对神经科学和心理健康至关重要，而fMRI提供了一种测量神经活动的方法。本研究旨在利用fMRI预测未来大脑状态。

Method: 采用4D Swin Transformer作为编码器学习时空信息，并结合卷积解码器，以保持输入fMRI数据的时空分辨率。

Result: 模型在预测7.2秒静息状态大脑活动时表现出高准确性，预测结果与BOLD信号高度相似。

Conclusion: 研究表明，Swin Transformer模型能够高效学习大脑时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和开发脑机接口提供了潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Motivation: 当前车道变换预测研究多局限于仿真或数据集，缺乏实际道路部署的验证。本文旨在填补这一空白，展示一种可在真实硬件上运行的车道变换预测系统。

Method: 系统分为两个模块：感知模块负责环境感知和特征提取，预测模块利用预训练的KGE和贝叶斯推理模型预测目标车辆行为，并转化为纵向制动动作。

Result: 实验验证表明，系统能提前3-4秒预测目标车辆的车道变换，为自车提供充足反应时间，确保安全。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将车道变换预测算法应用于真实硬件，验证了其在实际道路中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），用于改进自动语音识别（ASR）中对罕见词（尤其是同音异义词）的纠错能力，并通过保留概率机制减少误检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有ASR后处理方法（ED-CEC）在识别发音相似但拼写不同的罕见词时准确率低的问题。

Method: 在ED-CEC基础上引入音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），并加入保留概率机制以减少误检。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC在保持合理推理速度的同时，进一步降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在纠正同音异义词方面表现更优。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在罕见词纠错方面优于其他上下文偏置方法，且在推理速度和鲁棒性上优于基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍和老年语音识别面临数据稀缺、分布不均和说话者异质性等挑战，隐私保护需求推动了联邦学习的应用，但进一步加剧了这些挑战。

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和新型损失正则化方法，在联邦学习过程中进行多层级优化。

Result: 在UASpeech和DementiaBank数据集上，正则化联邦学习系统显著优于基线FedAvg系统，WER相对降低2.13%。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习能有效提升隐私保护的语音识别性能，高频通信可接近集中式训练效果。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Motivation: 现有语音处理工具缺乏验证，可能导致行为相关信息的不可靠性，影响模型在多样化人群和情境中的可重复性和公平性。

Method: 通过比较OpenSMILE和Praat提取的语音特征，评估其在自闭症青少年中的可靠性。

Result: 发现不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，这些差异影响了模型在不同情境和人口群体中的性能。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关的验证，以提高机器学习模型在临床应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers

multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without

Conclusion: 该方法为ASR模型的伪标签生成提供了更高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the

Motivation: 云游戏中，数据中心资源利用率低，因为游戏引擎通常仅支持单个玩家，导致GPU资源浪费。

Method: 在开源游戏引擎O3DE中实现Capsule机制，支持多玩家共享GPU。

Result: Capsule使数据中心资源利用率提升2.25倍，且无需修改应用程序。

Conclusion: Capsule设计可推广至其他游戏引擎，提升云服务提供商的资源利用率。

Abstract: Cloud gaming is increasingly popular. A challenge for cloud provider is to
keep datacenter utilization high: a non-trivial task due to application
variety. These applications come in different shapes and sizes. So do cloud
datacenter resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs, NPUs.
  Part of the challenge stems from game engines being predominantly designed to
run only one player. One player in a lightweight game might utilize only a
fraction of the cloud server GPU. The remaining GPU capacity will be left
underutilized, an undesired outcome for the cloud provider. We introduce
Capsule, a mechanism that allows multiple players to seamlessly share one GPU.
  We implemented Capsule in O3DE, a popular open source game engine. Our
evaluations show that Capsule can increase datacenter resource utilization by
accommodating up to 2.25x more players, without degrading player gaming
experience. Capsule is also application agnostic. We ran four applications on
Capsule-based O3DE with no application changes. Our experiences show that
Capsule design can be adopted by other game engines to increase datacenter
utilization across cloud providers.

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级RL微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在微尺度制造中仍优于机器，但机器人技术可以通过控制算法和摄像头位置优化来减少环境不确定性。

Method: 设计了多机器人控制系统模拟定位过程，并提出摄像头移动策略算法以寻找噪声最小的最优位置。

Result: 多机器人控制系统显著减少了制造过程中的不确定性，摄像头位置优化算法有效降低了图像噪声。

Conclusion: 控制算法和摄像头位置优化是减少制造不确定性的经济高效方法，为自动化制造提供了新思路。

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阅读障碍影响全球10%-20%人口，亟需创新且易获取的诊断方法。

Result: 随机森林分类器准确率为88.58%，并能识别不同严重程度的阅读障碍。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪与机器学习结合为非侵入式诊断提供了高准确性和可及性的解决方案。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本检测方法，通过任务对齐提示（zero-shot-s²）显著提升AI生成图像的检测性能，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成的图像越来越逼真，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加。传统监督检测方法依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。

Method: 利用预训练VLM进行零样本检测，提出任务对齐提示（zero-shot-s²），通过特定前缀引导模型更聚焦的推理。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，zero-shot-s²将Macro F1分数提升8%-29%，表现出强泛化能力和模型规模鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLM的潜在能力，为AI生成图像检测提供了一种简单、通用且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine

non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并将其应用于深度学习中的神经网络模块（如Tversky投影层），在图像识别和语言建模任务中表现优于传统的线性投影层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学研究表明，深度学习中常用的几何相似性模型与人类感知不符，而Tversky的基于特征的相似性理论更符合心理现实性。然而，由于离散集合操作的挑战，该理论尚未在深度学习中应用。

Method: 开发了一种可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并通过梯度下降进行学习，提出了Tversky投影层作为神经网络的构建模块。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层比线性投影层相对准确率提高了24.7%；在GPT-2的PTB任务中，困惑度降低了7.5%，参数数量减少了34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性建模范式，同时提升了模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有delta压缩方法在高压缩比下性能不佳或依赖经验位分配，需更有效解决方案。

Method: 提出ADAMIX框架，基于量化误差数学推导，将位分配问题转化为0/1整数线性规划。

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX分别比最佳基线Delta-CoMe提升22.3%和6.1%。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过自适应混合精度压缩策略，显著优于现有方法，适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标嵌入有效解决了语义层次结构的建模问题，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Result: 实验验证RollingQ能有效恢复多模态Transformer的动态适应性。

Conclusion: RollingQ方法简单有效，对提升多模态Transformer的广泛能力至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（如SSTI）导致模型决策失误，甚至被恶意控制。实验表明，少量虚假标记即可显著影响模型行为，且LoRA秩的大小与模型对虚假标记的依赖程度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PEFT方法（如LoRA）在高效微调中的潜在失败模式，尤其是模型对虚假标记的依赖问题，揭示其可能被恶意利用的风险。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI) 技术，在多个模型（Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, Meta LLaMA-3）和数据集（IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, Bias in Bios）上测试PEFT对虚假标记的敏感性。

Result: 发现：1）单个虚假标记即可操控模型决策；2）LoRA秩与对虚假标记的依赖程度成正比；3）高LoRA秩在强SSTI下能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT方法需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，高LoRA秩可能在某些情况下提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

Conclusion: RAG系统的投毒攻击直接放大模型偏见，需关注其公平性问题。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Result: 理论框架解释了多个实证现象，并统一了先前的梯度分析和分布分析。

Conclusion: 这是首次将推理时注意力形式化为蒸馏过程，为未来的提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when

*Paul Setinek,Gianluca Galletti,Thomas Gross,Dominik Schnürer,Johannes Brandstetter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SIMSHIFT数据集和评估套件，并扩展领域适应方法以提升神经代理模型在未见问题配置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代理模型在未见问题配置下性能下降，而领域适应技术在视觉和语言处理中表现良好，因此探索其在仿真任务中的应用。

Method: 引入SIMSHIFT数据集，包含四个工业仿真任务；扩展领域适应方法，利用源配置的参数和仿真数据预测目标配置的仿真结果。

Result: 实验表明领域适应在仿真任务中具有潜力，但分布偏移下神经代理模型的鲁棒性仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 领域适应方法在工业仿真中具有应用前景，但需进一步解决分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

*Zhenyu Hou,Ziniu Hu,Yujiang Li,Rui Lu,Jie Tang,Yuxiao Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeRL框架通过结合树搜索和强化学习，优化了LLM的推理性能，避免了传统方法中的分布不匹配和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在LLM强化学习中表现不足，树搜索能更好地探索推理空间并提供密集的过程奖励。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，直接结合树搜索进行RL训练，引入中间监督并避免单独奖励模型训练，采用高效分支策略。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务中，TreeRL表现优于传统ChainRL。

Conclusion: 树搜索在LLM强化学习中具有潜力，TreeRL框架开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at
https://github.com/THUDM/TreeRL.

*Hsi-Che Lin,Yu-Chu Yu,Kai-Po Chang,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMLoC是一种基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正，使模型微调在推理所需的内存预算内完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但针对特定领域或个性化任务的微调因内存开销大而成本高昂。

Method: 利用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: EMLoC在多数据集和模态上优于基线方法，支持单24GB GPU微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个人用户提供了高效实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

### [244] [Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation -- A Systematic Analysis of the Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11022)
*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过LLM迭代反馈生成的代码中，安全漏洞显著增加，挑战了迭代改进提升代码安全性的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在代码生成中迭代反馈对安全漏洞的影响。

Method: 通过400个代码样本和40轮改进实验，采用四种提示策略进行分析。

Result: 仅五次迭代后，关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略产生不同漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 需结合人类专家验证以降低风险，提出实用指南以避免迭代中引入新漏洞。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMirage是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估AI生成代码的检测器，覆盖10种编程语言和10种先进LLM，揭示了当前检测器的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在编程语言覆盖和生成模型能力上不足，无法满足现实需求，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: CodeMirage通过涵盖10种编程语言、包含原始和改写代码样本，并整合10种生产级LLM的输出，构建了一个全面的基准测试。

Result: 评估了10种检测器，揭示了9项关键发现，展示了当前检测器的优缺点，并提出了未来挑战。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发鲁棒且通用的AI生成代码检测器提供了严谨的测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

Result: LeanExplore提供了高效的搜索功能，并支持与LLM集成，增强Lean 4工作流。

Conclusion: LeanExplore有望提升Lean 4的工作效率和AI驱动的数学研究。

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,
data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows
and AI-driven mathematical research

### [247] [LLM-as-a-Judge for Reference-less Automatic Code Validation and Refinement for Natural Language to Bash in IT Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11237)
*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动评估方法（LLM-as-a-Judge），用于验证和改进Bash代码生成的质量，通过双向功能匹配和逻辑表示提升评估准确性，结果优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IT自动化中，自动评估和选择最佳模型以改进代码质量是关键，需要验证生成的代码在语法、语义和执行上的正确性。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，以执行评估为基准验证其准确性。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在准确性上与执行评估高度一致（优于基线8%），并通过反馈机制提升代码精炼效果（准确率提升24%）。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动代码验证和精炼中表现优异，为IT自动化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在编程竞赛中表现优异，但与人类专家相比仍存在显著差距，特别是在复杂算法推理和案例分析方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估LLMs在编程竞赛中是否真正超越人类专家，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 引入LiveCodeBench Pro基准，由竞赛奖牌得主标注问题并分析模型失败案例。

Result: 前沿模型在中等难度问题上的通过率为53%，在难题上为0%，且表现依赖于实现精度和工具辅助而非推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs与人类顶级水平仍有显著差距，需进一步改进代码推理能力。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.
